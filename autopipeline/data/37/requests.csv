"We're in Tampa Florida...moving to Ybor on Friday. My email is usfstuff@yahoo.com, since I'm having major trouble figuring out reddit's message system.


My two roommates and I have found a new place to live and are moving in on Friday. The rent is $1100 including utitilies and internet. My 2 roomies have very nicely offered for me to just pay $200 a month until I have a job. I am so thankful to have them as friends! This month all of us are extremely poor from paying $2000 to landlord (first+last rent+deposit). We also had to pay $310 for TECO to turn on the electricity.


I would just really love to do something nice for them and pick them up a pizza and a sub/pzone. My one roomie doesn't love pizza and she only ever gets a sub/pzone haha. Using a few coupons, I can get 8 pizza rollers, 1 large pizza, and a pzone for $11 from Pizza Hut. If anyone can help me out I would be so grateful! Pizza Hut is just the cheapest, if you have something else in mind let me know. I have an interview on Thursday so keep your fingers crossed!

It's been a difficult couple months for my boyfriend (22M) and I (23F).  He is currently unemployed and looking for a job, and I am self employed, but all my income has been needed to cover our bills while my boyfriend has been out of work, so there is absolutely nothing left.  I spent the whole afternoon trying to get local assistance to put some money on our M-Power card (a pay-as-you-go program for electricity here in Phoenix Arizona) to NO AVAIL : ( all our local agencies are either full for appointments or not assisting those without children in the home.  So we are keeping our apartment dark and very warm (it's currently 108 degrees outside!) having to be extremely cautious with any ac use as our electric is about to run out.  My boyfriend ran around today using the very last of our gas going to job interviews and the required drug testing.  We could really just use a filling dinner so we can collect our thoughts and regroup since we need all the energy we can get to figure out a way to cover our very basic needs until we get more income.  There are no groceries here, I actually used the last of what we had here (some vegetables, rice, and tuna) to feed our two dogs.  Of course we would be incredibly grateful with any form of help from anybody.  A Pizza Hut gift card would be amazing, and any other help as well.  I do understand there are other subreddits for assistance also and I will look into those guidelines to see if it is appropriate for me to post there too.  

In exchange for any help someone can give I would like to make you a small beaded item.  I could do a brooch or a pendant with seed beads, crystal, felt, some semi precious gem beads I have here.  You could tell me what colors you like and I could make something for you or a loved one.  I am open to suggestions.  Included are examples of what I can do.

I'm a poor about-to-be-a-premed-student-starting-tomorrow. This is terrifying. Pizza (and maybe a salad, so I don't feel godawful fat. Just a pizza is dandy too) would help calm my nerves. Alas, I have no spare money. So, I am proposing a magnificent trade- I will finish the scarf that I just learned to crochet on (which will be finished in three or four more days), and a drawing of a narwhal, for pizza. Or a penguin, or an abrictosaurus, should you want the picture sent off NOW, because I already have drawings of those. Both are pretty awesome.

[Half-finished scarf](http://i.imgur.com/c1Gax.jpg)
(I'm gonna finish the scarf in a lobelia blue, then black, and then maybe repeat a color or two to get it up to 5 feet long. Right now it's just about exactly two feet. Full disclosure, I did learn to crochet right before I started it, so the beginning isn't great. If you're willing to wait a week or two, I can make a new one from scratch that will all be nice. In that case, your options for colors are hunter green, pale blue-gray, a deep slightly reddish purple, lobelia blue, silver gray, and black. I can do stripes, and will do zig-zags but they aren't perfect. Stripes are way better. Anyway. Those are your options. I could totally do a bitchin' Slytherin-esque scarf (no coat of arms), or a black/silver/gray one, or... your options are endless)

"Dear reddit:

I am a long time follower but have only recently just registered. A long story short is I am fucked!!! I am a 30 year old male from St.Catharines, Ontario (Neil Peart, Linda Evangelista, Paul Bernardo, Karla Homolka, Dave Thomas (SCTV), Alexisonfire, The Trews, etc, etc) who was evicted as of today and my place to live just fell through! I have no where to live so as soon as the sheriff shows up I'm homeless and though I have $40 on me I  want to save it incase I need a ghetto hotel room for me and my girl.

A little back story here, as I feel it's needed to shed some light as how I got to this point; when I moved into this place I was working steady overtime in sales but got laid off soon after I moved here. Not to worry I quickly found full time work, working midnight shift for a company called CCSI which had a contract to clean the New Food Classics plant here in St.Catharines. I have worked since I was 16 and am now 30 so no work was driving me nuts so I took first job I could get.

The job itself wasn't bad but the amount of corners they cut was very noticable. My very first day of work they told me the safety video was broken so I would have to do the training in a few days... I didn't get training until after I called Ministry Of Labor (Ontario) which was after I was already injured, but I I'll speak about this later.
 
I did the work no problem and was quickly promoted within 2 weeks, though that was partly due to the high turnover there as most people hated the job and quit.

While working there I requested training weekly with my manager to which he would reply some excuse about the dvd still being broken or doing it next week. Not wanting to be a bitch I kept working despite my concerns.

Fast forward a few weeks and we have an inspection from CFIA (Canadian Food Inspection Agency)so everything has to be tip top. One of the duties when CFIA comes apparently was the ceilings of the plant had to be squeegeed dry as to not have any condensation from the cleaning drip into the frozen foods that were being made there (ie; burgers, ribetts).

While I was squeegeeing the cook room while my co-workers were out smoking, not working, I spent 2 and a half hrs doing it myself with a squeegee on the end of a 20 ft pole. Afterwards I couldn't move my neck without severe pain and later after my shift I couldn't sit in a chair without severe pain. I tried to sleep as it was the end of a midnight shift but my muscles would spasm to the point I couldn't sleep. I then called TeleHealth and they advised I go to a walk in clinic.

There I was diagnosed with a sprain of the left and right traps and lats, I think, traps for sure though.and sent for 3 months of physio due to the severity of the sprain. I did the entire 3 months but still no relief but the entire time my pysiotherapist is telling me there is something more there,

A month later Im at a hospital with insane back pain after vaccuming which I hadnt done since injury and I get x-rays. Doctor at hospital I need to see family doctor and have MRI.

See family doctor a month later, do some tests and he sends me for MRI. MRI results come back a month and half later. 2 herniated discs, spinal stenosis and degenerative bone disease caused by injury at work. Prognosis: No bending, No lifting, No twisting... FOR LIFE!

July 4th I see a neurologist for an EMG to determine whether I have back surgery but I have already been told they can't fix my back it will only be if it can improve my quality of life.

Oh and because WSIB says my back should be healed because its only a back sprain that takes 3 months to heal, I am all better, I have no income, no food, am being evicted as of today (June 25th) for back rent 3 months ($3300) but on the bright side I do have a lawyer but it's taking forever and welfare is not enough!!

Can reddit help with a pizza for what may be my last night indoors for a while?

"Our rabbit, Bugs got sick.  He lost 30% of his body weight and as a result his temperature also dropped a whopping 8 degrees F below normal.


We spent somewhere over $100 on his initial vet bill, Critical Care (this oatmeal like grain food to have him gain weight), hot pack, hot water bottle, space heater, and an extra amount of his favorite veggies.  I also work 2 hours away (seasonal position, I basically just get work whenever I tell my boss I'll be in town) and had to cancel my shifts for tomorrow and Sunday.  My boyfriend has missed work to care for him, and I've missed school so I'm also way behind.



He needs 24 hour care so we're taking turns sleeping and watching him, and both of us are never out of the house at the same time.  He's eating more, we're keeping his temperature consistent, but he's not gaining any weight.  His mate died a few months ago, so we think that's why he stopped eating.  This is taking every bit of our energy.



If he doesn't start gaining weight soon, he'll need blood tests, stool sample tests, and a couple others along with an increased dose of Critical Care, an antibiotic, and a probiotic.  The estimate from the vet was just over $400, so we're cutting corners everywhere we can.  Keep in mind, that money doesn't count for the extra veggies from the grocery store (our rabbits always get fresh veggies, but since Bugs is now refusing timothy hay, which is supposed to take up a large majority of his diet) we're having to buy, which is going to add up over the next few weeks, possibly longer if he continues to ignore his hay.




So, if you've made it this far, I'm just asking for a pizza, or pasta, or something from Pizza Hut, Dominoes, or Black Jack (those are the closest places to us).  If you have a random gift card for *any* restaurant in the Tucson area, we'll be grateful for that too/instead.  Anything to keep us from Ramen would be so appreciated.




**TL;DR** Our rabbit is incredibly sick, and we've already spent just approximately $131 on his special care, not including the extra veggies.  This was our grocery budget until the next paycheck comes in, and we've both had to miss work to stay and care for him since he needs literally 24/7 monitoring.  The vet gave us an estimate of $400 for extra tests he could need if his condition doesn't improve.  After we run out of the food in the house, we're going to be on ramen for at least 2 weeks, possibly a month or longer until he gets better.  Pizza wold be wonderful.",False

I started a new job as a baker for Stop n Shop after not having a steady one for the past three years. I absolutely love working due to my natural high energy level, so it's awesome! However my body is adjusting to the activity level which is one of the highest in my life - I also dance daily since I found rhythmic movement is necessary for me to regulate my emotions and impulses. However since I'm broke due to screwing up my landlady's dirt patch and rent being due, I'm on the beans/ramen/seitan diet which I don't actually mind at all except I dropped six pounds in the past week and every muscle in my body hurts in a new way. I can't afford used clothes from the thrift store anytime this month unless I get birthday money, can't afford to take the bus home, and I don't get paid til Thursday.

My bf helped me out giving me a lift home a couple times because cars beep at me and people yell stuff while walk home from work exhausted :( Our gf is in chronic pain and feeling depressed due to trying to be a bio major after going through two windshields and injuring her ankle BAD on the job when I met her.

I just moved into a small new flat with my Mum, after my brother died recently and she couldn't afford to keep paying the mortgage for our old house. Everything is pretty much still in boxes and all the cupboards are empty, so my Mum has been leaving me money or a sandwich from Tesco or something to keep me going. We had an argument last night because she was drunk and she promised she would stop drinking, and when I woke up this morning she hadn't left any money or food, so I have nothing to eat all day long. I have no money (the wallet was a figure of speech - I don't have a wallet!) at all, not even £1 to go and get something cheap from Tesco. I woke up early this morning due to being hungry.

"Hello, 
30 year old from TX panhandle area
So anyway, i'm struggling! I live in a rural community with hardly any jobs or places to work, and i work online the best i can on surveys and writing articles etc.  I am a remote PC technician and have lots of experience with IT/tech field, but no clients in this area.   I haven't ate for almost 3 days and haven't smoked cigarettes either, because i can't afford them, and actually feel a little better, I just have periods where I want to HULK SMASH everything in my apartment!  I do however have 7mg patches that i acquired from the VA administration.  Yes i'm a veteran, but do you really think just because you signed a contract with the federal government they are going to take care of you for the rest of your life? No.  People that deserve disability have to fight for years to get more percentage of benefits and it's hard.  I am on hud but there is no income.  I offer my services for pizza or paypal  I can Remote in to your desktop or laptop PC only, SCREW APPLE!! and optimize and speed up your system.

But at that point I didn't care because my bagel was done. It burned in the toaster. Hurt but not knocked down I scraped the black off the bagel and put some delicious salmon cream cheese on it (if you don't have salmon cream cheese get some it sounds extremely gross, but is actually pretty decent). Finally my little brother (14) tried to snatch my bagel out of my hands. He knocked it into the air luckily I bobbled it enough to regain control of my delicious snack. Unfortunately, I also bobbled cream cheese all over my arms and face. but fear not! I took revenge by sneaking up on him from behind and slapping a large amount of cream cheese on his face (the good kind).

"So, I [wrote](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/lsqto/i_would_like_to_take_a_moment_to_rant_about/) a week or so ago about the problems I was having getting the student finance company to get my loan to me, and it still hasn't been resolved and I've reached the end of my overdraft (they'll only give me a £200 overdraft until my loan comes through). I tried to go to my university to get some emergency funds and the lady I spoke to said I could only get a £50 bridging loan which seeing as I'd have to pay back in 4 weeks she didn't want to give me. And after arguing with her for quite a while about how I needed the money to buy food she said that it didn't matter because the lady who could've given me the money left at 2pm (I went in at 1:30pm, she was just arguing with me for that long). 

I then went into my bank to try and get my overdraft extended and they told me I needed to do it over the phone, went home and called them up and apparently I needed to go back to my branch and do it. And it would be shut by the time I went in again today.... 

So could anyone possibly send me a pizza or like... any other food? I haven't eaten all day :( ",True

"Let me start by saying that this site is incredible.  First of all, it's encouraging to see so many wonderful people out there helping each other.  That's just magical.  The other side of that is while I'm not glad to know there are others going through what I'm going through, I am glad to know that I'm not alone.  I think that's probably the hardest part sometimes.  You look around and you see everyone else, and no one lets on that anything is wrong.  Some people make life look so easy.  I haven't know easy in a long time.  There's a Sheryl Crow song that goes, ""No one said it would be easy, but no one said it'd be this hard.""  I hear that in my head a lot.  I'm not looking for easy, I just wish every minute wasn't such a struggle.  

I will say this though.  Today has been an amazing day.  I came on here looking for help, and have found myself being able to help others.  I can't tell you how great that has made me feel today.  This is a feeling that everyone should know.  

My husband died a little over a year ago.  I have been working three jobs to try and support our two kids who are 3 and 4.  In January I went back to school to pursue a degree in nursing so that I could have a steady future.  I can not tell you how intimidating it is being back in school all these years later and being a mom on top of that.  It's going well though, and I'm excited for the future.  

We are barely making it each month, but we find a way.  My daughter is going to turn 4 in two weeks, and I'm having a small party for her at our home.  It has a modest budget, and I've been coming up with what will hopefully be fun cheap activities for the party.  What I'm hoping is to make it a pizza party.  It's just something that the way the bills fall and the money comes in that I'm not in a position to really splurge on.  
I'm praying for some help and appreciate anyone who stopped to even read this.

Thank you.

"Her name is Chinadoll and she apparently had an enormous hairball stuck in her intestines.  We had taken her to the emergency vet clinic and they did a bunch of tests on her and all of them were really expensive, and then they told us that she would need surgery (which was $2000).  She is home and getting back to being her usual rambunctious self, but of course she should be lying down and recuperating.  We're all dead tired due to sleepless nights of waiting around at the clinic and worrying about her, of course, and could really go for some pizza.

As for the story behind Chinadoll, she is a huge, fluffy, grey cat.  She is sometimes very sweet and loving but usually cruel, stubborn, and dominating.  She is always far smarter than us, very energetic, and very beautiful.  She has been described as a ""probability cloud of evil"".  As a kitten, she was rescued from being hanged by some young assholes.  My SO and I love our four cats as our children, and the other two people in our house see them as family, too.

If you want to treat us to pizza, there are four people here and we like Cottage Inn.  Other pizza places would be fine, though.  An e-gift card would be the best for this, I think.

Here are some photos of Chinadoll: http://imgur.com/a/AMKC6

"Okay, so I'm going to try to keep this short, and stay with me because it really is a series of slightly unrelated events that landed me in my situation. Sometime on Sunday, my Xbox Live account was stolen, and almost $140 dollars worth of Xbox Live points were charged to my debit card. I called Xbox and got help getting a claim filed as soon as I realized. THEY said it would take 25 days, and I should contact my bank if I want a speedier return of my precious monies. They also said my Xbox live account would remain suspended until their investigation was complete.

Today after work, I did so, getting another fraud case opened by my bank. The banker said, or so I thought, that my card would be closed **in** 5-7 days. Mission accomplished, I head to the grocery story to buy something for dinner.   

I had my food items rounded up and checked out, when BAM! My card was declined. Okay... maybe they went ahead and turned it off for purchases. No worries, my bank is across the street, and while they may be closed, they have an ATM.  

Maybe you see where this is going...  

OM NOM NOM went the ATM, gobbling my debit card and spitting out a mere slip of paper in its stead- in essence it said ""this is **our** card now, criminal.""

"Okey Dokey... I requested a Pizza yesterday on account of being out of food. I did ask kind of late and did not get said pizza, my bad. I did not, however, go to bed hungry. It dawned on me that I had all the stuff for vegan fudge, I'm not vegan, or vegetarian, but I am pretty clever. Here's what I had for dinner. 
     3 cups sugar
     1 1/2 cups water (use coconut, almond, or regular milk if you've got it)
     2/3 cups of coco
What you wanna do is boil the shit out of these 3 ingredients until they pass the ""hard ball"" test... What's that you ask? you just drizzle a little bit of the mixture into a bowl of cold water and if you can reach in and form a ball your mixture passed (Test frequently until you have the hang of making fudge)... Once your fudge passes the test turn off the heat and toss in a TSP of Vanilla and a Half a stick of butter if you've got it (I made mine with just sugar water and cocoa last night and it was still good). At this point you can toss stuff in your chocolate goo... Nuts, Raisins, those little cranberry raisin thingies... Ya know whatever, I like to dump a load of peanut butter in there when I have it. Super easy!

Anyway, so the only food I've had around here is potatoes. Which wouldn't be so bad, but there's really nothing to put on them (no butter for baked ones, no ketchup for fries, no oil or vinegar for cooking them with.) It's better than no food, but the combination of dry potatoes and tap water is crazy bland.

Didn't know this until I called my bank.  So I got charged money for being poor...and then got charged more money for not having enough money, though I would have survived the second charge if not for the first.

My parents are in the process of moving into their new home after being homeless for about a month. There have been a lot of really frustrating and stressful developments over the past nine months leading to my parents moving into this new home. I've taken most of this week off of work to come and help with this transition.

Unfortunately, after I arrived I learned that they have delayed the actual move-in days because the previous owner was a ""crazy cat lady"" and the house still reeks of urine. (There are visible signs of spraying in some of the rooms.)

I have learned that over the weekend my mother spent most of her time shampooing, and re-shampooing all of the rooms. Today my father and I spent most of the day addressing  and then moving in the heavy furniture and furnishings. Hopefully if all went well with the previous cleanings, we'll be able to start moving the majority of items into the home. (Unless it is decided that the carpeting will need to be replaced first.)

Anyway, long story short, it would be fantastic if we could have pizza for dinner tomorrow (Tuesday) night. I'm not financially able to supply any food while I'm staying here, and I was hoping that maybe someone would be willing to help us out.

I'm a young gal living in Brooklyn, and I just moved from my cozy apartment into a basement room.

"My partner and I will have been together (in person) 7 years tomorrow (April 16).

We meet online while I was teaching in Korea. When I finished my contract, I went home (NZ) for a month before I flew to Sweden to meet him in real life. Prior to that we'd Skype 6-7 hours a day, email and send letters

Life has been really hard. I haven't been able to go back to NZ, we had to go through his family company (no fault of their own) going through bankruptcy, moving country and visa issues.

We left our jobs at the end of January and moved out of London in the hopes that we could find a place to settle down and have kids. 
We lived in at our jobs and worked together in a very stressful situations that really began to affect our relationship and health. Another reason we needed to move.

We've found it really hard to find jobs since though we've applied for everything and anything, pub jobs, cleaning jobs anything.

Tomorrow is our 7 year anniversary and we can't afford to do anything.
Which is ok, we still have each other and we're getting along really well again despite the pressures and stress of both being out of work and worried sick about money.

Anyhow, a pizza tomorrow night would be well-appreciated.
And the favour will be paid forward as soon as we're in work again.

That's normally not a problem here in Germany, but to make a VERY long story short: The government agencies that are supposed to help you out in a case such as this didn't help me out. I haven't recieved any money in 3 months. So I have been living off of left-overs some friends bring by sometime. I'm a freelance voice-actor, but I haven't gotten any contracts lately, except for a bigger one 1 1/2 weeks ago.

However, my 'boss' there hasn't paid me yet. I'm about to lose my apartment and I ran out of food.

I'm not sitting idly by though - I've been sending out CVs like crazy and have gotten an interview for next week. We'll see how that goes.

So yeah, there's the short version of what happened. I don't really know what I'm supposed to write here, sorry. If you have any question, go ahead and ask.

If anyone is actually willing to send me pizza, then there could be a minor problem seeing as I live in Germany. But - if you have a credit card (mastercard/visa) we could use [lieferando](http://www.lieferando.de). I can guide you through the ordering process via Skype for example - or I'll write something up.

"I preemptively realize that this post is at a severe risk of sounding like a pity party, but I want to make it clear that I am not trying to create a sob story here. But, I also want to be honest. Know that I am happy (pizza or not)! With that disclaimer out of the way, here is sort of what is happening in my life, cliff-note style.

-I am poor in the college-student sort of way. My parents are broke, so I worked my way through college working for AT&amp;T 40 hours a week.

-I did well in college

-Upon graduating, I received a US government grant to move to Taiwan for a year.

-Yay!

-However, there was a six month gap between college and moving to Taiwan, one that was really hard to fill with employment. So, we are pretty broke.

-The last few weeks of my life have been insane. Applying for visas, passports, getting medical clearances, seeing every doctor in town, selling my car, buying a new wardrobe, packing or selling everything I own... you get the idea. My GF and I have been waking up, scrambling all day, and going back to bed. We are exhausted and broke.

-I am leaving to Taiwan in 4 days, and I still have so much to do that it's quite upsetting.

-From what I understand, the pizza situation in Taiwan is quite depressing :(

So, I ask for some help for my GF and I, one last chance to eat some pizza before we move on into the unknown (and one less thing to have to figure out tonight as we continue packing).

I had always read about this sub-reddit, but never participated. I always figured that if I did, I would be giving away a pizza. But, at the moment, it seems life put me in the position of the requester.

Pizza or not, I think this is a really cool subreddit, and I am super excited to be moving abroad, despite all the stress involved with preparing.

Thanks for listening, and I can't wait until I am in a position to be the pizza giver.

"So I had an ex-roommate who owed me a portion of the deposit from our last place, and I stupidly gave him my bank info so he could wire the funds to me. Note: I used to have a wells fargo account so thats how we used to transfer funds easily for rent etc... but I moved and found it easier to use a schwab account since they refund atm fees and having a brokerage account all in one was nice for when I wanted to start trading. 

He took this and then basically managed to create an e-check to citi to pay for a credit bill. Why the fuck citi decided hey lets accept a check from a random person to cover another persons bill I will never know. Schwab didn't stop it in time so it took out a good chunk of my checking account before I noticed what had happened. After spending hours on the phone over this last week with the fraud dept, I was told that they would create a new checking account for me and transfer my remaining funds, but that my debit card would remain active.

Today I'm at a gas station trying to fill up when my card doesn't go through. I call and found out there is nothing they can do it to link my old card with my new account and that they have to send me a new card, which wont be here till monday. So I had to spend my last 10 dollars in cash to get enough gas just get home. (If you don't now how schwab works can't walk into a branch and just withdraw money, you have to use your debit card at an atm, thats why they refund the fees) Now to add to all of this when I was younger I messed up my credit pretty badly, and I have been working to fix it recently but its still not good enough to get a credit card without just getting raped on fees. So basically I have no acces to any money at all until my new checks or debit card arrives. 

Also being a single guy during finals I didn't really stock up the fridge that well, so I am standing infront of my fridge/pantry to see that I only have 5 eggs, 7 slices of bacon (the one thing that may keep me sane lol), a little oatmeal and lots of moldy veggies left. Now I could stretch what I have l easily for 2ish days, but that still leaves me short tonight and tomorrow. I normally am not the kind of person to ask for a handout but if anyone could help me during this perfect shitstorm that would be make my week. The second I have access to my accounts and money again I plan on passing it along. 

TL;DR: I got fucked by my ex-roomate. To ""protect"" me schwab locked all my accounts while telling me I would still be able to use them. So i've got no money till monday and am just short of food to make it till then.

"I just want to start off by saying how wonderful this community is. I've been looking at some of these posts on here, and how helpful and giving those within the community have been, and it really warms my heart to know there are people like that out there in the world.

I'm wondering if there a chance someone would be willing to help me out as well. I'm a stay at home mom, raising my three little ones, Jason (6) and Michelle and Christina (both 3 1/2), while my husband works. Sadly, he lost his job about a year ago, and with this economy, he has only been able to pick up jobs here and there, and we're getting towards the end of our savings.

I would love to be able to sit down with a nice pizza dinner one night, and just be able to relax and enjoy the company of one another, that is, before the little ones start crying again. Pizza used to be a luxury purchase for us before, now it is almost impossible.

Anyone with a soft spot in their heart able to help out?

Thanks

Most of the new jobs in my hometown of Tullahoma, TN, are far beyond my reach of experience (i.e., medical jobs like registered nurses, etc.).

Most of the time we have to rely on local churches to help pay our bills and put gas in our car. While a pizza would definitely raise my spirits it would do the same for my parents.

"Hello RAoP!

My fiancé and I have been living on cereal, grilled cheese sandwiches and jello for almost 2 week now. Our [fridge](http://imgur.com/pXp9j) is bare aside from the essentials (milk, cheese, bread) and will remain that way until the 3rd. I'm okay with eating this way for a couple more days but my guy is going crazy. He just went off to work with a sack lunch of the usual and made a comment about how his stomach is shrinking and it made me feel bad. I was thinking about a hot meal I can make (for us for when he got home) with what we have but there's not much. Plus, I have a fussy baby on my hands. We have an 8 month old who is a high risk infant so she gets a monthly RSV shot to prevent her from getting the nasty virus. She's been a handful since yesterday :(

I've never requested a pizza here before and we aren't really the types to splurge on eating takeout. But if I had the money I'd do it today, as it would raise our spirits. I just got my verification code so if anyone can hook it up I would greatly appreciate it! I would also pay it forward as soon as I'd be able to :)

"So, about a 2 months ago, I found a job. It took me three months of searching, and this one was part time and only paid about $650 a month- barely enough to get rent and food out of the way. The rest of my expenses have been coming out of my dwindling savings account for a while now.

I also got a stress fracture in my foot about a year ago. I was in and out of a walking boot for about 5 months altogether, and my doctor and I thought it was healed. I could walk 2-3 miles at a time and not encounter any pain and I thought I was in the clear.

And then I got this job, which required standing in one place for 8 hrs at a time. I did fine at the beginning, but then the pain started coming back. I guess my foot just couldn't take it. I got an ultrasound on it two days ago. Turns out the fracture has broken again, and I now also have arthritis in the surrounding area. I'm back in a walking boot. The one I have this time had to be a loaner from the doctor's office because insurance wouldn't pay for a new one. This one goes up to my knee and is a size too big, and it's hard to get around in it.

(I've also figured out that I can't really get worker's comp for it because it was a gradual injury, and in Virginia you're required to have a specific accident happen. It's also unlikely to happen because it happened previously not in the context of work.) 

My boss got really snippy with me when I quit, and I just had to sit there crying for a while after I hung up the phone.

So, I'd love some pizza. I could make it last for a few days, and that'd be 3-4 meals that I wouldn't have to stand up to make. It'd be really helpful. As soon as I get a job where I'm not struggling to get rent, utilities, and food out of the way, I will definitely return the favor to someone else who needs it.

"So here is my family's story: girl meets boy, they fall in love, get married, have teh cutest baby in the world! Somewhere along that path girl starts working for scumbag corporation. When it comes time for maternity leave as the lil' redditor is close to being born, scumbag corporation says 'don't worry, all of your benefits will continue, you'll get paid leave, have fun with teh baby cuddles.' 

Well, we really wish it had worked out like that :( I took a full 12 week leave, as available to me thanks to FMLA. 7 Weeks were paid thanks to short term disability, but my company made me wait 3 weeks to get that money, which sucked. My insurance and all of my benefits got cancelled while I was on leave, even though I was assured they'd continue. When I got back to work two weeks ago I fought tooth and nail to get them back, but my benefits department is making me pay out of pocket for the premiums from the time I was on leave and the benefits got cancelled. That adds up to $200 a week... multiplied by 12! They are automatically deducting the payments from my paychecks for the next 4 weeks, after already doing so for my last two checks. They are leaving me with so little in my checks that we've had to dig deeply into our savings just to start paying our bills, and unfortunately we've had to give up grocery shopping until my premiums are caught up and scumbag corporation takes them back over. 

Luckily our adorable son gets all he needs from me, so my husband and I are just living off of what's in our pantry, and that has been box after box of pasta. We'd kill for something with flavor at this point, and a pizza sounds like heaven. As soon as we get caught up financially, which according to my strict budget won't be until late November, I plan on doing the same for another redditor in need!

This week she refused food and eventually last evening passed away.  My wife did get to see her Thursday, but she looked ""vacant"".  We both agreed we would donate her to the local university for them to perform the autopsy and possibly see what caused her liver to fail.

I am asking for her for some pizza from the reddit community.  This is really for my wife because of the attachment that she had with her.  I can provide verification of Tula and the autopsy (when we get it).  But Pizza and bread sticks would cheer up my wife.

I've got some food to hold me over until friday if I'm creative w/ my meals but I've only got $10 in my wallet and anything left in the bank is going in my tank to get to work. I've had a rough weekend and I could use a pizza tonight. I'll pay it forward on payday.,True
"Pretty much what the title says. Felt a little stress from the weekend (relationship problems), so I decided to unwind a little bit with some weed. Now I'm feeling the munchies and I realize that I've got no food in the house, and I'm not okay to drive to go out and get money or anything. A pizza would be very appreciated. Located on the East Coast of the US, thanks for your time. Any Ents here?",False

"My husband is an ice cream man making 25% commission. I'm currently jobless waiting to hear back from a temp service. My husband works his ass off for free pretty much, because he cannot find a job not even through the three temp services in our area. When he first started this job he was making amazing money. But things slowed down extremely. He went from bringing home $100-$200 a night to $15 or less a day. He also has to pay for gas which is $15 a day. So as you can see he's not making money at all right now.
    The only reason why he is staying with this job, is because the owner is making him co-owner next year and also letting him stock vending machines so he'll be making two salaries. So my husband is trying to keep whats best for our future in mind. 
  However I'm in starvation mode, I've lost 4 pounds in one week due to not eating. I've been snacking around the pieces of moldy bread, hoping for my husband to have a good day and hoping I hear back from the temp service that is suppose to be contacting me back.. I just called my husband and he's only at $60 (he makes 25% of that, which will be used for gas ) and he's going to be heading back to the shop in 20 minutes. So it's another bad day. My stomach is killing me. It would mean everything if someone could help out.

"Moved to CA, it's hard out here, looking for work, planning on ramen tomorrow for thanksgiving because it's all I have currently.  Roomate drank all my milk so it's Water for me!

I live with a sociopath downstairs that refuses all human contact, an elderly lady that is the owner of the house is going with family.  I came to the west coast to chase my childhood dream of becoming a Game Designer! I posses a B.S. in game development from brown college in MN where I overpaid for it.  I am currently relying on IT contracts that are very slow coming through and honestly I was not prepared for bus transfers costin $6.00 per ride from here to the nearest metropolitan city.  

I know three people out here, the mountains are beautiful, the ocean is breathtaking, and the way people smoke marijuana in the streets free of law enforcement harassment is still a bit of a culture shock for me to see.  

I don't expect a pizza, because every post I make on reddit i get a cynical post right away and a dozen downvotes.  but if somebody reads this and knows what it feels like to be alone on thanksgiving i'll feel accomplished i guess.

"A pizza tonight would be absolutely wonderful, but I'm on a beans and rice budget until I can finally find a new means of employment. I reside in Walnut, California. We have a local Pizza hut, and there's a Domino's and a Papa Johns just down the street from my place. I'll gladly accept absolutely anything, from anywhere. Even something as simple as plain cheese would be awesome. I'm a cheap date. 

This is my first time posting here, so I'm not entirely sure how this works. I'll keep tabs on my post over the course of the next hour or two in the hope it's seen by anyone willing to help. In return I can either pay it forward when I can, or order a pizza for you down the road once I'm back on my feet. Thanks in advance  :)

*Edit - I know, I know....my choices aren't exactly ideal, but alas those are the three closest options. I'm not exactly in a position to be picky, so even Domino's sounds great right now. But I don't have a preference between the three. Whatever is the cheapest still works for me. 

*Edit 2 - If you were planning on ordering a pie or two tonight and you're willing to share, I'd be happy to join you as long as it's a public setting. I'm still unsure how this all works....am I supposed to provide a phone number and an address to someone via PM?

Short of a miracle in the job department I'm still going to be nearly broke tomorrow and a little while beyond, so if anyone would like to help me out another day, that would still be great.

""Hi, I'd really love a pizza and a handful of sedatives. First chick to furnish both wins a date with me and a pillow covered in drool.""

A friend responded with this link.
Nothing special about my story, but here goes.
A bit over a year ago, I bombed out of college. Hard. After that, I was unable to find a job, even in the pizza industry, where I have 3.5 years experience, 1.5 of those in management. Throughout the year I have been bouncing around between cities, going back to Eugene and Corvallis for a time, and eventually went to Texas because I wanted to meet a girl I'd been talking to online for a year and a half or so and was quite enamoured with. That journey was a complete disaster, and months after I wound up back in Portland, I still think about it everyday. I still can't find a job... I interviewed at Voodoo Donuts the day before yesterday, and by now I would have heard back if I'd gotten the job. I feel like I kicked ass at the interview, but most 'cool' jobs in Portland are always won by scrubby hipsters and overly-tatted indie/rocker chicks. I'm an electronic musician, an artist, and writer, and slowly over the last year I've been watching a lot of the stuff I use to do my work break or disappear. My speakers broke, so I can't properly make music, I ditched 80$ worth of art supplies while I was trying to hitchhike to Texas, as it was weighing me down. My laptop's hard drive fried out but I was lucky enough to trade a much smaller one for some computer repair work. I've been couch-surfing various places this whole time, right now I am staying at a nice rasta lady's house with her schizophrenic ex-boyfriend and his mother, who has alzheimers. I'm lucky in that I get to stay in a room that is half-filled with their storage stuff yet has a bed in it. But I can't remember the last time I had a good pizza. Nevertheless, there are certainly people worse off than myself and if I had stumbled upon this sub-reddit on my own, I would've though that it was awesome, but would likely not be requesting pizza on it. However, since it was suggested to me, I figure I might as well give it a go.

What can I offer you? Well, I can send you a bunch of mp3s of my music, mail you some drawings, or perhaps help with some editing work if you have any writing you need someone to look over, whether for school or for personal writing. I live in the St. Johns neighbourhood of North Portland. Hope I got everything I need here, lemme know any questions or otherwise. Thanks reddit.",False

"Howdy RAOP! I've been in a giant funk lately that I've been unable to pull myself out of, then then tonight my son surprised me. He wrote me a little note saying that I should play Xbox with him and take my ""mind off of things,"" along with other sweet things. 

We played for about 2 hours while he asked me questions about when I was in 3rd grade and joked around about Space Chimps. It was the funnest time I've had in a long time and really reminded me about what's important. 

I don't have access to my account until Monday night since the fiance has my card on a trip for a class for work. I have stuff for the weekend but it's all meals that my son doesn't really enjoy that much. Since neither of us will go hungry this weekend I will completely understand if you would rather give to someone who needs it more than myself, but I would love to treat my ""punkin"" for everything he did for me tomorrow sometime. Taking a pizza to the park is one of his favorite things.

The last few days i've been really achy and sick and my mom didn't get child support for whatever  reason so we are scraping by until we get food stamps in a few days.

Currently sitting at home alone for the weekend, family is over 3 hours away, and my girlfriend... (or whatever she is to me after the falling out we've had over the past 2 months) is headed out for the weekend to go camping with her bestfriend. We're working on our relationship and part of that involved me moving out on my own so I could focus on myself, find a job, and seek help for my severe depression, until I've made progress towards getting my shit together she's not willing to say we're in a relationship more serious than ""seeing each other"" Sounds harsh, but really it's just because she wants me to prove that I'm actually going to get my shit together.

Today is one of those days where I've slumped into a depressed state, not nearly as bad as some days, but I've made progress and will continue to strive for progress.
I guess my hope is that someone will be kind enough to make my day, so that when I've got my shit together I can do the same for someone that was once in my position.

[Conversation, part 1](http://imgur.com/QkDp5.jpg) and [part 2.](http://imgur.com/ktmYJ.jpg)

Sorry, everyone, for getting your hopes up. I don't know what my fianceé ate last night. It's nearly 5am for me now, so I'll go eat some cereal and make a coffee, and start the day. ~~I'll message the mods here about this~~ (Nope, I have no info and it was only my trust), but only time will tell if we were scammed or not. I hope not.  I sincerely think that it was a first-time gesture that didn't go through.

I really don't mean to bother anyone, and thanks for the words and support you gave. 

**UPDATE 2** Hello, again. Thanks to everyone who messaged their support and well-wishes.

Although we never received pizza from *Random Acts of Pizza*, which has an obstacle regarding cross-border exchanges it seems, it should be noted that *we did have pizza* last night from some old friends of ours who invited us back to our hometown.  It was a great night out and all of us got some great laughs and good social vibes.

*(The first* ""boy pizza"" *had pepperoni, bacon, tomato, and red pepper; the second* ""girl pizza"" *was feta cheese, sundried tomato, red onion, and green olives.  There was also 20 deep-fried wings, ordered with BBQ sauce but supplemented with the home's own Frank Sauce. A jug of Nestle Ice Tea Zero was offered and shared all around.)*

I just want to thank everyone who has offered to assist my fianceé and I in the last few days. She's as astounded and overjoyed at this post as I am, and we thank you all sincerely.  She also keeps nudging me to start accepting some of the gratuity, Since I was fence-sitting because of my morality, ethics, and humility, I've decided to graciously accept a few offers (if still available) via private message. If declined, I fully understand with no ill will.

Once again, thank you, everyone.  You are an awesome community, and we love you.

**TL;DR** Laid off, pizza offer fell through in possible scam (though hopefully not), Reddit comes through with offers and consolation, we get pizza from friends back home.

"First off, I will admit I am new, and I made my account after discovering this subreddit.  But I have been a lurker for quite a while and have even gotten my mum addicted to this site (and the aww sub).  
Right now I have no gas, and that in itself is nothing new.  But I also have no food, or cash.  I'm not really a fan of spilling my life story.

I ended up becoming her carer and after about five years of constantly hiding anything sharp or pill related and just generally taking care of her, I kind of snapped (or broke. However you want to put it).  It's now eleven years later and the depression pretty much controls my life.  
I do get enough money to pay most of my bills.  Though gas and shopping are the lowest priorities.  I have gas/electric here, so thankfully the gas doesn't heat the water for the shower.  
I'm not the type of person that can put off paying the bills in order to buy groceries.  Even though sometimes I really should.  That's just the way I was raised.  Sucky, yes, but at least I have the internet and tv to keep me from going insane.

I won't get paid until next Friday, which will be kind of a stretch. Not looking for anything major, just hoping for a nice random act to keep me full until tomorrow afternoon.

"So yeah... employer just told me to be packed up and out of here in two weeks this past Friday.  I'm backed up on my finances because of kidney stones that were so painful that I couldn't work a full 40 for a few weeks.  My job has no benefits and I couldn't afford to go to the doctor, so I manned up and gritted my teeth through it without awesome drugs...  
  
Now my power, internet(which I'm downgrading soon) and TV service(i'm cutting the cord as soon as this stupid contract is gone), cell phone bills(on contract so nothing I can do here) are all late.  I've been late on my car payment twice in the past 5 months.  I can't afford to pay any of them right now because my rent is coming due, and if I don't pay that on time they charge a $50 late fee plus $10 for every additional day late.  I also need gas, and my car insurance is going to be due in full soon.  And I have a huge student loan in my mother's name with myself co-signed that I haven't been able to make the payment on for a few months... so I'm just hurting her.
  
I live alone and haven't really made many friends since I moved to this state.  I've been begging for part time jobs for over a year and no one is hiring me.  Now I'm close to being unemployed and my employer(staffing firm) hasn't found me a replacement yet.  
  
I'm subsisting on Ramen, buttered pasta, the cheapest hot dogs I can find, and any other sale items I can find for less than $1 per dinner, around .50-.75 for lunch, and I don't even eat breakfast.  
  
Before the troubles started I loved that new Dominos pan pizza.  I'm a cynical, pissed off, ""hates everything"" manic depressive who doesn't like to smile.  But that stuff always puts a smile on my face.  
  
  
I'm going to join this sub, and as soon as I can I will return the gesture if someone can help me feel good again for a little bit before I start looking for stuff in my apartment to sell to pay these stupid bills.

I am but a humble tall ship sailor, which as you well know, in this day in age means I've taken vows of voluntary poverty. Teaching children how to sail an 18th century ship is well and good - however there's a point where one realizes that it's not paying the bills.

I've applied for work at the Seattle Art Museum (they have some awesome exhibitions coming in), but should I get this job, I won't see positive pay off well into next month. 

Thus, Pizza Gods.. here I am, a sailor with a roof, but no nom'ibles. Please, if it is within your power to do so, send me a sign - an omen of good will that will get me through the night, and hopefully tomorrow - I'll find out if I get that job tomorrow or not.

"hey there- I have a special request. Sunday afternoon I am driving from NH to Baltimore to see a lupus/antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) specialist at John's Hopkins as APS is pretty rare and I have been pretty sick recently and getting worse, not better. 

A friend I actually met through a couch surfer I hosted has become like a surrogate dad to me and is flying here from California to drive me down- he is an incredible person and I owe him my life. He does so much for me and has agreed to drop everything to make sure I get the care I need to get well. 

Anyhow, he is paying for everything for this trip- including the visit if I can't get any financial aid help (have submitted an application) as I don't have insurance. I can't tell you how blessed I am to have this man in my life. 

Other than gratitude I have nothing to offer him as I am very broke due to my illness keeping me from working despite trying desperately to get well enough to resume my career. 

Can anyone arrange to have a pizza delivered to where we are staying either Sunday night when we are due to arrive or Monday for after my appointment? I think he would appreciate it and I know I would more than words could say!

I am still not sure where we are staying yet or exactly when we are arriving but I can let the giver know the exact details as soon as I know.

Instead of just asking for a pizza, let's make this a symbiotic relationship. I will write a song about whatever you want. (Literally.) It will be catchy, awesome, and recorded in the form of a high quality mp3, in exchange for a delicious ham and pineapple pizza. I'll even submit it to you before you send a pizza, if you're wary about the deal.

If you're interested in hearing about my business, I'm funding Step 1 through kickstarter.com. [Here's the link to that](http://kck.st/pgKaih) Back me, or send it to a friend you think might be interested in a personalized song.

So I heard you can request pizza here, well I just bought $200 worth of groceries yesterday so I'm good. I wanna repay a favor to a friend I've known for a very short time, but he's done a lot for me in that time.

I lost my job a while back and started posting up my stuff for sale online. He's been a godsend to me, he's bought stuff from me on multiple occasions and helped me eat when I wouldn't have been able to otherwise. He lives an hour away and he travels down here to buy from me and even takes me to the grocery store so I don't have to waste money on a cab! I've known the guy less than 2 months and he's already been more awesome than anyone else has been to me in probably my whole life.

He's been sweating some bills due this week, but even though he was strapped he helped me out big time earlier this week. I had to notarize my I-9 for my new job and get my driver's license renewed. He spent 5 hours on Tuesday not only taking me to the DMV and the notary, but he did it with money out of his own pocket. I tried to pay him back yesterday but he wouldn't let me, he said he did it out of friendship. The mans struggling to pay his bills this week and he helped make sure I could get back on my feet at long last, now that's a friend.

He's got 2 kids under the age of 7 he's in his late fifties no less, so the man is definitely a warrior in my mind. I won't start getting paid for a few more weeks, but he's had it rough the past few days and still put me before himself. I wanna thank him but I had to buy three weeks worth of food yesterday in one sitting, plus pay for the cab ride, so I'm  fresh out of dough. It never even crossed my mind to send him a pizza until I wandered on here. He can't very well turn down dinner when it arrives at his door free of charge, so that's what I wanna do.

Anyone think they can spot me a gift card so I can send him some dinner tonight or tomorrow? He's been awesome to me these past few months, he even overpaid me for some of the things he bought because he knew I needed the money. This would be a small drop in the bucket but I wanna pay him back for some of his kindness at least. I don't mind coming back in three weeks and returning the favor, I'm gonna be set making 14 an hour at this job, but he could use this right now, I know he could. So pretty please, will someone help me make this man's day?

I've lost my appetite because of a major life crisis, but now as I'm trying to get back into the swing of things I need to be strong but severe loss of financial stability (i think the technical term is being broke as fuck) means that I'm starting to break down physically, and that will jeopardize my ability to get back on track with my life.

I would actually prefer groceries (maybe milk, bread, or eggs), but I know thre is no Random_Acts_of_Balanced_Nutrition out there. I don't even know if I can get food stamps by now, and even if I can it might be too late. Either way, I would appreciate pizza just as much.

"For quite a while now, I have been nonstop hard at work on an interactive multimedia project called [[6x]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmCqEP2v_Wo) - a double-disc immersive experience with hours of puzzles, ""flash films"", trip-tools, hallucinogenic visuals, and TONS of hidden features.  Caught between a surreal nightmare and warped mindtrip, this DVD package presents an immersive journey through hypnagogic insomnia in which the viewer is in full control.  Composed from hundreds of sources of bygone media - deconstructed, distorted, glitched and reassimilated into a mind-bending menagerie of disturbing and psychedelic ventures into the user's psyche.  Think of it like a interactive-video-game/experimental-art-film double-DVD set, with a heavy emphasis on the experimental and interactive.

*Note: Contains disturbing and/or adult material. Intended for mature audiences only.*


The project is currently in the autumn stage of development and production (about 70% complete) and slated for release [here](http://0011011001111000.bandcamp.com/) on August 20th, 2013.  Previews available [here](https://www.youtube.com/0011011001111000) and [here](http://0011011001111000.tumblr.com/), though it's difficult to convey the interactive aspect of the project in pictures and videos.

**So here's the thing:**
I'm broke right now and pretty hungry, but I do have the DVD package to offer in exchange.  The only hitch is - it won't be released until August 20th.  So if any redditors are interested in the DVD or hooking a hungry brother up with some pizza, comment here!

"Hey Reddit, I heard about this sub-reddit for a little while now, and think its an awesome idea. I'm a 24 year old college student from South-West Sydney, working a part-time warehouse job to help pay bills, and just moved into a shared accommodation. Things weren't always this difficult. I had a girlfriend live with me, so sharing bills and having food wasn't an issue.

But now that I've been single for a year, and trying to make my way through college, things have been rough. I have depleted any savings I once had, and my credit cards are shot. I still have at least another year in college, but seriously need to consider some kind of alternative to make my way through this.

I rarely go out with friends because of my situation. I haven't had a beer in ages, and can't remember the last time I ate 3 square meals in a day. I might only have one meal a day, because I have to consciously ration the food and money I have. I even invested in hair-clippers recently, just so I can save money on haircuts. I have been living paycheck to paycheck for the past few months now, and putting food on my plate is simply getting more difficult.

It's kind of depressing actually. I never have thought surviving alone would be so hard.

I must admit, I had a little too much pride to think about asking this pizza Reddit before, but long story short... I'm starving. I'm very embarrassed to ask anyone, as I don't want people to know how poor I am. However, if someone could help a brother out, I would forever be in-debt. Its not just about the pizza, its about helping someone in a time its needed most. I would most certainly love to be able to ""pay-it-back"" to others who need help, when I get back on my feet (if I find my feet at all).



**UPDATE:**

**EDIT: ** Received the Pizza, and it was the most tastiest bloody pizza I have tasted in a long time. **1stGenRex** you are so awesome. Reddit should be proud to have members like you and others who have offered a kindness that literally makes me want to tear up.

Here are some pics. Oh before I forget, **1stGenRex** decided to be extra awesome by spoiling me with a box of [Magnum minis](http://i.imgur.com/0BfhY.jpg) and a pepsi. Here is the evidence that **1stGenRex** is one of the coolest mofo's on Reddit:

I'll be sure to keep subscribed so that one day, I can return the kindness onto others. I can't believe you Reddit. You guys are too awesome.",True

So here is the situation:
I am requesting pizzafication on behalf of a friend of mine who does not Reddit. She is a young mother, married, and with two children (3 and 1). She recently moved to Glendale, AZ from Florida. She was supposed to be able to stay with an In-Law. That plan fell through due to circumstances outside of her control and she has to vacate her current residence this Friday. She has one other family member in the city that she will be moving in with. She has a job lined up with a call center but doesn't start for 2 months (she has to wait for the next training classes to start). 

**So yes, long term, she will be OK.**

The problem, is that DES hasn't approved her application yet (she has not been in the state long) and she and her husband are skipping eating meals days at a time. Thankfully she is still managing for her children, at the expense of her and her husband eating. I am just looking for a meal to help her get to next week, where I am pretty sure she will be OK (and I will be able to lend further aid at that point if she isn't). ",True

I will be able to pay forward this one and the previous random act of pizza when I can get my life straight. I will pay the previous one forward whether I get food from this or not.

They had told me to ""enjoy a week off for Thanksgiving and spend time with your family."" That was nice, I figured my Christmas bonus will make up for the 40-hour loss. Then I come back ready to work, 2 days later I get the boot. Keep in mind, this is 2 weeks before Christmas bonuses go out. 

So I lost 1 week of pay, no severance, no bonus, and no job. My wife is a full-time college student that isn't even allowed to work (she will lose her scholarships.)

This is going to be a very tight and hungry Christmas for my wife and I. And we would greatly appreciate something good to eat so I can use what money I have left to pay bills until I find another job.

If you need proof, I'd be happy to tell you anything. We are a very generous couple and once I get another job, I would be happy to pay it forward.

"Hey guys,

I've made my way in to uni at 8:30pm to work on assignments and get ahead in general. I came straight from a netball game to here, so haven't eaten a thing since lunch.

To explain the title, I am absolutely and completely broke in terms of both spirit and cash. The year started off with my girlfriend of 4 years breaking up with me and having to move out, which sunk me into a state of depression.

I was working full time, but had plans in place to go back to uni and leave my job. My annual leave payout was going to cover my credit card debts, and I was to rely on welfare + a part time job to cover rent, bills, petrol, etc. The annual leave payout was a lot less than I anticipated, as I was taxed a lot, meaning I could only pay off one credit card, and the rest paid my rent in advance for a couple of weeks to make sure there were no issues there. Centerlink have screwed me around, and have told me I may potentially be waiting six months before they start paying me. I've been looking, but struggling, to find part time work. I made $100 last week for fixing a family members computer, and I put in about 15 hours of work to earn that money, but haven't seen any more since. 

My car rego is now overdue, I have two months of unpaid phone bills that need to be paid, when I run out of petrol (I have about half a tank at the moment) I have no idea how I'm going to get to and from uni, and I have absolutely no idea where the money for my car payment and insurance is going to come from on Friday. Not to mention the required payments for my other two credit cards, which I'm now starting to get payment reminders for.

The reason I'm struggling with uni is that because of the depression, I'm also suffering from anxiety, and it has been a real struggle to get myself to uni. I've been stressing about where the money is going to come from to cover all my bills, and what I'm going to do when I need to start making rent payments again. Not to mention being out dealing with centerlink and desperately looking for work.

Please help a fellow redditor in need out and sort me out with a pizza to help me get through the night. When a source of income comes in, I am more than happy to return the favour. When I do have money, I try to regularly made it a habit to help people out. I'm also happy to fulfil requests, but bear in mind that I'm at uni.

Thanks in advance =)

"Long time occasional lurker, first time poster here. I am 21, a recent college graduate, who managed to land a game programming job prior to graduating (and by luck my job actually pays well), however this month when trying to get ahead in tuition loan payments and spending a bit to try to get into basic electronics engineering as a hobby I managed to somehow end up in quite the situation. Due to a compounding of unexpected expenses, netflix pulling money out of the wrong (and empty) account, a rather large (at least for me) loan payment, and well simply an outright failure to budget this month... I managed to become absolutely broke aside from the bare minimum I need to get to work once this week (I work from home mostly as well). 

For the past week I've been limited to the scarce quanitity of frozen meals that I bought about two weeks prior, however three weeks ago for what ever reason I acquired a large amount of soda. I ran out of food two days ago and my only intake since then has been soda. At first I was like, ""No big deal, I get paid in a few days"", but that has turned into ""MAYBE IF I USE THESE NAIL CLIPPERS I CAN CARVE A HOLE IN THIS 360 CONTROLLER TO LIVE IN THIS SODA CAN COLLECTION"" mental instability.

Long story short, I have no karma, no food, but get paid in about 3-6 days (my job is slowly moving to direct deposit but hasn't set me up yet...) and I would really like a pizza. In exchange, I'd be more than willing to pay you back as soon as I get paid, or do some small task of some reasonable sort.

I prefer Dominos, a medium pizza and a ""build your own breadbowl pasta"" (usually a coupon deal online) can last me almost two days, but really I'll take whatever I can get as I'm not exactly in a position to choose.

Here's the sitch (is that how you abbreviate it? I know how it's said, but I don't think I've seen it in writing....)

My girlfriend has been working hard to support us since I lost my job. Long hours, crappy boss, you know the drill. 

About an hour ago I just got a short gig, so I can start to contribute again, but it will still be a while before we're back on our feet completely.

As I feel it is my boyfriendly duty, the least I can do for everything she does, I give her a lot of massages. Back, neck, arms, feet, I do it all baby! I'm rubbing those knots out like nobody's business.

But now my hands remind me of my grandpa's (except the skin doesn't look paper thin). Knuckles the size of cherries, stiff as a board. Ok so that's quite an exaggeration, they don't really hurt. But still.

I would love to be able to have a pizza tonight with her, as a sort of thank you type date thing, since we don't always get to eat together and it's never something you find on /r/FoodPorn

Anyway - I'm sick to death of supermarket own brand tins of crap and bread that's a day out of date (But 15-20p so bargain, right?). Allow me to have some pizza and allay my fate.

she has some facial bruising and bruises to her hands, and from talking to her on the phone tonight she is pretty terrified.

"I got out of the Marine Corps several months ago. I am from Texas, and for the past few months I've been preparing to start college in Florida. The original plan was I would drive here to Florida, take a test, then return home and do my coursework online for the first 90 days, which would give me time to pull the funds together for the move to Florida. Unfortunately, they failed to inform me that the online option only applies to students who do exceptionally well on that test, which I did not. Just for the first trip, I had to sell something that was very important to me. Then I took the test and they told me I either had to give up my dream of becoming a student at their university, or move to Florida immediately. I returned to Texas and did everything I could think of to raise money for the early move, and in a final act of desperation, I sold even more of my belongings. Now I am in Florida, with 2 boxes of clothes, sleeping on a fellow classmate's (who also has no money) couch, with $2.00 in my wallet, wondering what I will do for food for the next 30 days, which is when my Veteran's Benefits kick in and I will finally be able to afford to eat.

"Hey fellow pizza-lovers. 

It is coming to the end of the semester and I am about at my breaking point. Me and my roommate are bio majors (senior year) and we are currently taking microbiology. FUCKING. HELL. I don't want to go on too much of a rant here, but essentially, our professor is not a very nice person. When hurricane Sandy came rolling through, given that we had missed at least a week and a half of school, most professors took this into consideration and removed certain assignments that were due considering time constraints. NOT THIS BITCH. In fact, she added onto the syllabus. In the end, we had a little more than 400 pts due in the last week of class in an 800pt course. I have never been so stressed in my entire college career and I think my roommate is about to lose it. 

Our freezer is empty. We run to the caf when we can (considering its not closed because our school sucks sometimes), but it has been the same food since the beginning of the semester, and quite frankly, makes me piss out of my asshole. With our final in the class coming up this Tuesday, it would really be an unbelievably generous treat to have some pizza to help us study for this test.

Hi there. I'm a 22 year old male who has recently moved. Since moving, I've lost a friend, been mugged at gunpoint, had to replace an alternator, and now I have to replace the struts my car. In fact, it should have been finished a week ago but due to some reasons I'm unaware of it seems that the mechanic I hired has cancelled on me three times and wont even answer the phone at this point. He even has the parts that I paid for sitting on his property. I simply don't have the know how to do so, or I'd do it myself.

As far as losing a friend goes, someone had a change in plans regarding my living situation. I was to stay with her for a few weeks while I found another place. She told me to find a new place pretty much immediately and that I was acting like a child, ect. I wasn't even there half of the time, so I honestly do not know why she went so crazy. It kind of hurt to see her suddenly change like that, since we were friends for so long.

In any case, it's getting pretty rough here lately. I can't leave this end of town for any reason due to my car problems so grocery runs are limited, too. I'm lucky enough to work really close to where I live, so there is limited strain on the car in its [current state](http://i.imgur.com/Z5sdP.jpg). (The strut has recently fallen completely off.)

I didn't realize that bit until yesterday, the one-year anniversary of my purchase (I posted a whole thread about the episode elsewhere). The result - a surprise $500 charge to my card.

And of course all of this happened when my payment plan failed as a result of my financial aid being literally obliterated this year. The state decided to take my grant offers away.

So that was just really rough. I feel awful and scared and screwed and I have no idea how I'm going to to get out of this debt any time soon. Doesn't help that I was planning to go to grad school next year. No idea how that will work out now.

"Food stamps are now 2 weeks late due to moving counties and a new case worker that is slow as molasses in January. She's had my completed file for 2 full weeks (as of Friday) and still hasn't ""processed"" it. (Whatever that entails..) 

My family (Me, Hubby, and 2yr old baby girl) have been living off our pantry and freezer for 2+ weeks. Last night we used our last chicken breast. Today was literally buttered rice.

The food stamp office is closed till Monday morning at which point I will be calling my case worker, her supervisor, as well as her supervisor's supervisor; hourly, if necessary, until I have money to buy food for my family.

Until then anyone wanna send us a pizza?

"[Request] Out of Saint Louis Missouri. (Specifically The Soulard Area)

So here is my story, Hopefully it will warrant delicious pizza..

For the past 5 months i have been an addict in recovery.
At one point i realized i no longer wanted to keep living the way i was living.. Talked to my family and got help. I was addicted to Amphetamines and was starting to develop a bad heroin habit. I spend 42 days in rehab.. Came out with a new lease on life, and spent the next 3 - 4 months in a sober living facility. Just trying to remember how to live and enjoy life sober.. I got the best job i have ever had (Contracting for charter) and after a month i was promoted to be the south Saint Louis Market contractor. (Basically i managed all southern saint Louis contractors)
Things were going great, With my new job i rented out a new apartment Set myself up a home office, and genuinely enjoyed day to day activities. Then one day, When i was heading back from a Narcotics Anonymous meeting, I got pulled over in Illinois (15 minutes from my apartment in Saint Louis) The Police Officer Informed me that i had an outstanding warrant in O-Fallon Missouri for Possession of a controlled substance. You see, I knew that this warrant was a possibility, But i had assumed they would let me know when they decided to issue the warrant! 6 months prior (Before Rehab) i had been arrested for Possesion and they had let me go, With no ticket, Not even a court date. Since that was my first serious charge ever i had assumed they would at least let me know if i had a warrant.
Well. Long story short(er) I ended up spending 5 days in a holding cell in collinsville Illinois, 2 Days in Madison County, and 1 day in St Charles County. MY mother had got me a lawyer so that i could bond out (they didn't want to let me post 10% so without a lawyer my bond would have been 20,000) and ended up spending 5k just so i can hopefully keep my job.

She had hoped that by getting a lawyer and since this was my first offence, ever, We would be able to preserve my job. Well, No luck. I lost my job because of my 1 week absence and the fact that i had obtained a felony. Since i was a contractor i cannot collect unemployment.

So here i am. 1 month later. With barely Any food in my fridge, A carton of cigarettes, and an internet connection that will be shut off any day now. I have until the 30th of august before i get evicted, and am currently considering moving back into a half-way house.
BUT i am STILL SOBER! Which i am proud of, Months ago i would have been wasted the second anything went wrong.
So i come to you, knights of pizza, humbly asking to Make my evening tonight. I would LOVE to eat something other than macaroni and cheese.

I can prove any of it! i can provide pictures of: Graduation certificates, An empty fridge, a hungry dog, anything you can think of..
Thanks in advance.

I don't usually beg for stuff, but I don't have anything to eat today. I've spent all of my dining hall meals this week since I was busy studying and ate an easy three meals a day.

"Well, here is the sob story.

I just moved in with my sister and brother in law.. They bought a new house and need a roommate, and knowing that I am just out of college and looking for work and all that.. they got me to do it. :P

The first week I moved down here, the small amount of money that I had to get through to find a job was frozen in my bank account because Bank of America is such a PoS. I was literally down here a week, and without any notice/phone call/email.. etc. they froze my account and reissued my debit card back to my parents house where I was living (a days trip away, in another state). I was there planning to cancel my account, when they told me I was going to be unable to do so without my new card... that was a couple of days away in the mail. So basically I am broke as shit. :/

I just started my new job down here, but they pay bi-weekly. I just received my first check, but it immediately had to go to the new bank that I have for student loans and car insurance, to avoid late payments. So for the next two weeks I am broke and even have to bum gas money off of my sister to get to work until I am paid, and she cant really afford to be helping me as much as she is already.

I'd really like to do something nice for her in the meantime... so, anyone want to give me a hand?

I have had a hectic month and have all but run out of money, by the time i realised i wasn't getting paid till the 1st i had maybe 3 or 4 pounds left in my account. Now i am already a student...a student who pays his own rent, and even with the maintainance loan and overdraft find myself on the poor end of the stick a lot. Now i as i am sure you are, am a lover of a good pizza. 


But with only 4 pounds i resigned myself to having to wait till the 1st. So for one week i lived on the 11p noodles at tescos, 3 meals a day of 11p noodles, With the promise of a pizza on the 1st though, my mind was battling through. 28th of Feb and low and behold it is a leap year this year....ok i say, that's fine, one more day, few more noodles i can deal,  I've come this far already. 


The first hits, and the thought of my pizza is incredible, my mouth is watering at the idea as i get out of bed. And the first thing i do is go to check my balance and pay my rent....Oh what's that? yes. My bank details were stolen? Virus on my computer? Now not only is the idea of my pizza gone, but the fear of being unable to pay my rent is gripping me tightly, i call the bank immiediately, and have my accounts frozen and my cards cancelled. it's evening seeing as i have a bad sleeping pattern and probably only woke up at around 5pm. i cannot make it to a bank today to check my balance, and with no cards, i definately cannot buy a pizza :( But tomorrow i tell myself. Tomorrow.


i head in the next day and check my balance the money is there, Phew, i take out enough money for my rent and be on my way. Oh no you cry, where is the money for my pizza. Well i forgot about that. and manage to fall asleep at about 5am that night waking up for bank closing on saturday. Great. Tomorrow is sunday.

"Hello, reddit! Long-time lurker, first time poster on reddit!

So at the ripe age of 22, I have finally moved out of my mom's house, and into an apartment with a friend of mine. Rent's been paid, bills are paid, hell, I even just got a job! Unfortunately, all our money has been spent on the aforementioned things, and we're down to rice and ramen in the cupboards until my first paycheck. (She's still trying to find a job). So I came here to petition for a pizza in celebration of our new apartment, new jobs, and hopefully a fresh start! 

In return for a pizza, I would be returning a pizza on the day of my first paycheck (The 27th) to whoever is so kind as to get us one tonight. Hell, I'll give one away either way. I am also not above taking funny pictures with the pizza, attempting some sort of art involving the pizza, or pretty much anything else silly that one might request in return for some of that delicious, cheesy-goodness!

It's Saturday, I have a little over $5 in my bank account, nothing but roommate chow at the apartment, a flat tire on my bike, and it's so windy and dusty out that the sky is pretty brown right now. 

By trade, I am a freelance writer. Sometimes it pays fabulously, the last few months not so much. But I understand the give-and-take of economy and I'd much rather put something together for you than accept charity. So I'm thinking a page of whatever you want for a medium pizza. Haiku about Thundercats, a love poem for your girlfriend to smooth over the fact that you got really drunk last night, I can get you started on that paper you're putting off, or just the word butt as many times as I can fit on the page. And none of that copy-paste bull crap either, I promise to type each one of those butts individually and by hand.

Maybe you want more than one page. These things happen. And I happen to be able to put away far more pizza than is probably healthy for me. Or I might want mushrooms AND pepperoni. We can work it out.

Just about the only thing I won't write is a signed confession that I was the one who committed that murder the cops are getting closer to solving. Let them figure it out on their own.

If you order a pizza for me, I promise to not only write for you, but will also enjoy said pizza ravenously while playing the video game of your choice, assuming I have it in my collection (odds estimated at 1 in 15). Can provide photo proof of brown sky, flat tire on bike, or other reasonable requests if needed. Will gladly provide gratuitous photo proof of pizza enjoyment if desired.

"I was evicted from my home this past monday.. I spent all last week desperately searching for a place to live..  Since I'm disabled, and still waiting for my benefits to start, I knew I could never afford a place for myself.. So I did what most people in my situation would do.. I had faith that between my family and all my friends..  SomeONE.. (I thought there would be many)  would find it in their heart to take me in, even if for just a short time..  After waiting a few days, I realized that no one was going to come to my aid.. So I decided to start asking those who I KNEW would do anything for me.. Or so I thought.. Immediate family turned me away without even a 2nd thought.. Since they were the only ones in my family that had room for me, I had to move on to my good friends.. My best friend lives 4 hours away so that just wasn't an option.. My other best friend AND neighbor would definitely take me in.. I just knew she would!!  She has an empty guest bedroom and everything.. So I asked if she could help me out and let me stay in the guest room for no longer than a month.. Without even pretending to think about it.. She said ""I don't have any room for you"".. That was it.. I had exhausted all my options.. One day before my eviction I started to plan the best way to be homeless.. I decided to live in my van.... Scary doesn't come close to how I felt, but my fear was deep.... Ring Ring! It's Curtis.. A friend I met thru my best friend.. I knew him and considered him a friend but we didn't know each other very well.. Without hesitation he said that he heard about my situation and wanted to offer me a place on his couch..  I burst into tears.. I was relieved.. But mostly, I was so touched to receive such extreme generosity from someone who is also struggling just as hard as I am!  So here we are at his 1 bedroom apartment.. Trying to figure out how we are going to afford something to eat TONIGHT.. Let alone tomorrow.. But It's 6:52pm and neither of us have eaten today.. I want Curtis to have this pizza cause he deserves it!  Thanks for reading! :)",False

I called back three times and every time they keep sending me to the same place that already told me no.

I never thought I would be in this position, I usually tough out times like these when money is scarce and survive on Ramen and bread.  Alas I don't even have money for that.  Due to my hours at work getting cut (I make minimum wage at a bowling alley) and just having paid rent I'm looking at 2 weeks with no food or Ramen if I'm luckily enough to find some change in the parking lot at work.  

How did I get into this position one might ask, well here is a brief backstory.  I moved out here to Arizona from Ohio to try and get clean from a 7 year hardcore heroin addiction that cost me my own business (I used to own a pizza shop ironically) my girlfriend her life (She overdosed and died in bed next to me last year) and of course I couldn't pay for school while still on drugs and found myself on the streets.  I've worked so hard to finally get a job, albeit its meager and they are doing everything in their power to keep payroll costs as low as possible, and stay clean.  Due to the state being broke I don't qualify for food stamps since I can afford my rent ( although BARELY) that seems to be the biggest deciding factor on whether or not I can get assistance.  I don't have any family as both my father and mother have passed away and both were adopted and had no siblings.  I just don't know what to do and am beyond depressed and fed up with life.  I work so hard and I can't even afford to feed my dog, let alone myself.  I just can't take it anymore, so I finally decided to actually ask reddit for help.  I would give anything just to not be hungry for one night.  If anybody out there is feeling generous, I don't know what I can do in return other than thank you daily for the next few months straight.

"Hi Everyone!

First time requester here and thanks for reading. I'd like to request a pizza for my partner of 7 years. I think it'd be a really nice surprise for him and he loves Reddit as much as I do, so it'd give him one heck of a smile. If you're interested, I want to provide some history so you know where I'm coming from and why I'd like to see that smile. I'll try to provide enough context without being too verbose :)

About 3 years ago I lost my job in marketing. I was the breadwinner in the relationship and he worked for fun, really. I set out to find another job at the start of the recession and it didn't go so well.

After about a year of being unemployed, living off savings and looking for another job that would pay enough for me to pay my bills (a big concern that stopped me from taking a lot of jobs due to pay requirements... we all have to service our debt obligations!)  I realized I hated what I was doing. I was 25 then... 2 years ago. 

It's strange and hard to describe, I think, unless you've gone through something similar. I worked hard, ever since I was 13 and had a paper route that earned me a couple hundred a month. When I was 16 I got a job at Best Buy and that's when my 'career' in sales took off. I sold on the Best Buy floor for about a year, then went to CompUSA where I worked as a commissioned sales guy. My first commission job and I was only 17. I made really good money and continued to progress through retail and then into retail marketing. 

By the time I was entering college I was making more than most people who had been out of college for years, and that number went up every year. That kind of money blinded me to the fact that I wasn't enjoying what I was doing... I was enjoying making and spending money. So much so that I burned through it faster than I made it. It was really the only thing I had fun doing, though. I dropped out of college (probably a good thing, since I was going for a degree I wouldn't want now).

I met my partner through Myspace at about the time I had gotten my first management position and was traveling 90% of the time. The first couple years were great. I was gone so much it was like a long honeymoon. Sometimes he'd come with me; Vegas, NYC, Seattle... etc. 

For his part he worked off and on. It was never a big deal... I made a lot more money than him. He'd always worked odd retail jobs, hourly stuff, customer service stuff. Never made over $10 an hour or held a job for more than half a year. I didn't care because I'd rather spend my time with him when I was home than have him working and making a couple extra bucks.

So, back to three years ago when I lost my job. After about a year of coming up dry, I fell into a pretty bad depression. I couldn't find work that would pay my bills, and realized that I didn't even like doing that work. It affected our relationship dramatically. I retreated into World of Warcraft and stopped talking to family. Eventually the money ran out and bills stopped getting paid. 

I hit bottom after a long, dark period... but thankfully for me bottom was a nice soft pillow of people that loved me. My parents stepped in to help get me through some tough financials and my partner stepped up to support me mentally and financially. 

Fast forward to today. My partner is now happily employed (1 year anniversary this month) with a company that is providing him with a promising career opportunity that he loves doing. We've downsized our lives; no car, eating cheap, staying in, cooking and we've moved into a studio apartment. My partner is working we're saving so I can go to school and do something that I do love; be a vet. He even got me a chocolate Labrador puppy in February. We named him Fizban and he's a constant source of joy for me. The person I was 3 years ago would not recognize the person I am today.

I try to do nice things for him whenever possible to lessen the stress of being the sole earner in the house. That's what this request is about. We're not starving, but we live tight. This would not only be a delicious treat for us, but once my partner found out that it came from a generous person on Reddit he will be amazed.

One day I promise to pay it forward. Here's a picture of my dog, Fizban and my partner:  http://imgur.com/SoygY",True

"Hi, RAOP. So, things are bad: I'm waiting on help from my relatives to pay rent (late) and utilities (also late).

I'm looking into getting help from relatives sooner rather than later on the power bill, but I don't know exactly when that's going to happen. At this point, I'd judge this request to be more of a need than a want. 

Full disclosure: We've gotten pizza through RAOP twice. Once was through a request a few weeks ago, and the other was a totally unsolicited offer after my girlfriend got into a conversation with someone here. Both times we were a bit better off than we are now, but we didn't have much to eat in the house and we couldn't afford the pizza ourselves.

"Well where do I start? Two years ago the love of my life dumped me because for 6 months before that I had become a drinking machine. It wasn't just when I was depressed. I would drink when I was happy, sad, hungry, tired, stressed. I would even go to work and school drunk. It became a major problem when I got alcohol poisoning. To keep her from leaving I agreed to quit drinking completely and start going to meetings. Suprisingly, it worked and I was on the fast track to living a much better (happier) booze free lifestyle. In the past month my girlfriend and I have argued constantly. Thursday night she confessed she had been cheating on me for about three months with my bestfriend, who had also helped me stop drinking. My gf left after that, she came home three hours later reaking of vodka and she had vomit in her hair, in her inebriation she told me how her and my bestfriend had been sneaking around partying together and ""one thing just lead to another"" and they had fallen inlove. This had come to me as a shock because not even 2 months ago she had agreed to help me take care of my brother when I got custody of him. Yesterday she left me she said she'd be back for her things. I tried to go about my day the way I would any other day, I went to my AA meeting got my 24 months sober token. I went to work and got through the day as best I could crying in the bathroom on my lunch break. After work I went to the bank to withdrawl money to pay my bills, only to find out she took all my money out of my bank account 20 minutes after my check was direct deposited. I didn't know what else to do. I wont be able to pay my bills or buy food. I don't know how I am going to feed the kids, or if we'll even have a place to live.

"I'm going to keep this as short, but still have it make sense, as possible.
I intended on moving to Pennsylvania from Nevada into my grandfathers house, was stated before I left that I'd already have a job at a local grocery store, and that everything was set for me to get there.

So I drive 2700 miles cross country in a car that shouldn't have made it, I spend practically all of my money in doing this.
I get there and everything is fine for about a day.
He decides that I cannot stay at the house when he's gone (I am almost 22), so two or three days after I get there, he has a funeral he has to be at, and me not comfortable going to a funeral of someone I didn't know, don't go. I drive around and drive by a little later and no ones there, so i get out of my car and say fuck it and lay in the front yard, get bored and leave again, 30 minutes later he's back and everythings fine.

The next morning he wakes me up at 10 asking me if I'm going to sleep all day, proceeds trying to get into an argument with me saying i tried to break into his house the day before while he's gone, accusing me of unlocking all his windows and says he knows I tried to break in because he has someone following me around taking pictures. Screaming at me that I'm a liar when I did nothing wrong, and he wants me to leave. So I gather all my shit up and call my uncle. He says I can stay in a run down trailer behind his friends house. 

I'm 2700 miles away from anything or anyone I know staying in a run down trailer, with no money because I spent $300 driving across country, no job because I was lied to, and looking at selling my car to get back home. My uncles broke and can't help me, the people I'm staying at frequently eat out. I have no cash, my cars out of gas, and it basically feels like no one gives a shit. I came trusting my grandfather was trying to help me, and all he did was displace me, break me, lie to me, and insult me. 

I'd just like something to get me through until I get the documents so I can scrap my car to a salvage company ( that I paid 1K for before I left) so I can get a bus ticket back to Nevada. Which should be monday or tuesday depending on how fast my mom gets to the DMV. And before you ask my mom is unemployed and unable to help.
I don't like asking people for help but I love helping others. This will definitely be paid forward as soon as I can.

"Hi guys, 
Normally I'm not one to ask for charity but I *really* need some help this time. I've been working a crappy, minimum wage job for the past year, and I finally got a new position working in a dental office (which is what my degree is actually in, but I haven't found a position until this past week), but I don't start there until mid-June. :( 
My boyfriend, who I live with, got laid off this past March and applied for unemployment benefits shortly after, but of course, nothing has been solidified on that end yet. I'm sure it's to everyone's surprise that the unemployment office isn't super reliable, right?...

So, I am here asking for some kindness to be brought upon us, as these past few months have been particularly trying for us financially. I am also in the process of recovering from a bad car accident a few weeks ago, so I've also had to worry about finding a new car, as well as trying to find a new, cheap apartment since our lease is up in July. Sigh. Growing up sucks sometimes.

To anyone that even took the time to read this, thank you! And if anyone even considers doing this favor for us, I promise you will be repaid in some form or another! You have no idea how much it would mean to us to not have to worry about dinner tonight. We are genuine people, we have just fallen on some hard times.

Now it could be Friday. I never had rental on my insurance because I never used it. Took the rental back Friday to save money since I was supposed to get the car back Monday. So here I am. No cash on me. I used my last bank check Sunday. Lost my debit card. And the bank is several hours walking distance from me. I really want a hot pizza to improve my mood :( luckily I am not superstitious and taking it as a sign that this marriage is a bad idea because we have so much fun together. Enough about me for now.

"Single Mom here. So, my oldest is almost 9. She came down with strep three days after school started back. Yay. =\ Had a semi stressful weekend with trying to keep her and my youngest (almost 11 months) apart so the youngest wouldn't get infected too. However, the baby woke me up at 2am yesterday morning with a faucet for a nose and a slight cough. Called the doctor to see if that warranted a visit, and low and behold it does. She was also positive for strep. She's a really good baby though, and except for being off her bottle (I guess the sucking hurts?) a little bit, and hating to have her nose wiped, she's dealing amazingly well. 

So to sum it up, I've got two sick kids and I'm behind on household chores (anyone got a laundry fairy they can spare??) and I'd really just like a night off from cooking dinner. I'm not desperate for food, and I totally understand if there are others who are and you'd rather help them. 

We're in Metro Atlanta, and are happy with any of the three major chains, but we also have Hungry Howies and Bucks pizza who both have online ordering. My oldest only eats cheese, and I'll take any meat product on the other side. Allergies to mushrooms, so please none of those. :)

I think I have a pretty decent resume (working on a successful political campaign, interning at a Congressional office, etc) but I cannot for the life of me find a job. Not having a car in a very difficult city to commute in is definitely a problem, but it doesn't stop me from taking the bus. But I can only go so far. A two hour bus ride makes an 8 hour day become a 12 hour day. And scheduling multiple interviews is difficult when I'm relying on the bus to take me. Nevertheless, I'm still pushing through and hoping that if nothing, Walmart will come through.

"Good day kind folk of /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza;

As stated in the title, my class is holding a debate on the true nature of man, good or evil- myself and half of the class on the 'good' side, the other half on the 'evil' side. While myself and my peers discussed various properties of our assigned moral alignment, the concept of charity came up in discussion- and some of us being redditors, we immediately thought of this subreddit.

It would be greatly appreciated if someone could send us a pizza of any size and type (preferably something generic) around 8:35AM PST, October 13th, and hopefully inspire our pessimistic peers to see past the idiocy and greed omnipresent in our media and wall street and realize that there is such thing as pure human charity. **We remain committed to returning the favour to the subreddit as well, to an equal or greater value than the sent pizza :).**

Note: We do not intend on using any sent pizza as a bribe, if there is enough to share with our small class of 15 people (it's an alternative high school) we will. We believe we have a solid argument and the pizza will be delicious evidence :).

First off - I will **not** *starve* between now and Friday, so if you'd rather help someone who has absolutely nothing, I understand, appreciate your stance, and thank you for helping someone truly in need.  

I've been unemployed for better than two years. During that time, I watched most of my photography clients (I did a lot of corporate work) shut down their budgets for expenditures like me. As that income dwindled, I began looking for other work. I'm not sure how much the year-long gap of ""employment"" (other than self-employed) has mattered, but I haven't been able to find anything. About a week and a half ago I finally got to the point I had to take a laborer job that's physically killing me (ok, it's only very painful). So I'll have something coming my way soon.  

In the mean time, I have a 1/2 sack of potatoes, a few cans of corn, 1/2 jar of peanut butter, 3/4 loaf of bread, and a few boxes of mac and cheese. All of which is pretty much what I've been eating for the past couple of weeks. Like I said, I won't starve, but I damn sure don't have a meal I'm actually looking forward to for the next week.  

It's just me. My dog passed the day after Easter, and as much as I'd love another pet, I know I'm not in a position financially to take on another right now. So even a medium pizza would be like 4 meals - I could take a couple of slices to work every other day for lunch or something just to break the monotony of what I've been having.  

I'm not hiding behind a new account - I am who I am. A quick look at my profile will tell you exactly who I am, and hopefully give you a sense that I try to contribute to the community as well when I can (/r/TOMT, /r/picrequest, gift exchanges, postcards to kids/random people/etc., general blathering). You'll also see where I've sold some of my camera gear to a fellow redditor because I needed the money. I feel bad asking when it's not a matter of ""need it or I'll die"", but I figure if I'm just honest about where I am, someone might throw me a ~~bone~~ pizza in the spirit of the *Random Acts* part of the subreddit.  

Either way, if you're still reading, you're a good person for even considering helping someone out. Thanks for being part of what makes reddit awesome.",True

"**EDIT** I am situated here in Atlanta, Georgia. Sorry for not posting the state in the title guys.

If this sub is anything like the rest of Reddit I might get a little sympathy for being a total idiot my entire life. To make a long story short I was born in Salt Lake so I was branded LDS from conception. My 21st birthday party was a trip to temple to hear president Hinckley (our ""Prophet"" at the time) speak about family. Even then I thought that was a lousy birthday. Up until yesterday I held priesthood in the church and was a key toting, card carrying member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.

That is no longer the case, I got up in the middle of sacrament on Sunday, and, after a less than friendly chat with our Bishop yesterday, I am officially done with religion. I've been on the ropes for years but the cowpies just got stacked one too high lately. So I've had enough. If God exists he certainly doesn't look well upon the LDS followings. You know how much garbage I caught for buying a cup of coffee on Sunday? Way too much. For one thing caffeine is a no no but another lesser known of my former beliefs is we're not supposed to do anything business related on the Sabbath day. No dining out, no work, no grocery shopping, etc. And the fact that I bought something turned almost the whole congregation on me. That was some good coffee too.

So basically I've spent 28 years trying hard to believe in something, spent 2 years in Japan trying to make other people believe it with me, and now I'm pretty much alone because of my refusal to believe in the most ridiculous things our church kept pushing on me. I got 2 friends who aren't LDS, the others won't stick with me after renouncing their religion so I'm in the market for new friends to boot lol.

If you have any questions about the spooky and mysterious world of Mormonism ask away. And if you could spare some dinner for a guy who's tax check hasn't arrived yet you'd have my blessing and gratitude. And no, not a religious kind of blessing. More like a walk tall and drink lots of water kinda blessing lol. Hope you're all having a nice day and thanks for reading.",False

"Hi. These last two weeks have sucked, and I would really appreciate not worrying about one thing--namely, food--after all the torrential bad events I've experienced. In short:

* Moved out of my dorm, physically exhausting myself by lugging all my physical belongings up three flights of stairs. 

* Learned my grandma has likely-fatal leukemia

* Got rejected.

* Car broke down. Towed for all the money in my checking. Problem not found, magically starts running again.

* Had to miss a week of work due to lack of transportation--less money, more problems

* Discovery that I can't cook well, and I don't have the cash to spend to improve my cooking skills (read: buy a cookbook, or a good square pan, or microwavable dinners).

* My other grandmother, the gentlest woman I will ever meet and the guiding role model in my life, passes away suddenly. 

* Car breaks down again. AGAIN. Fortunately, it magically restarts AGAIN, and I don't have to have it towed. But it's almost guaranteed now that whatever is going wrong is going to be expensive.

* I get a sunburn from the funeral, and a mysterious rash from apparently holding a rabbit.

* Grades come back. I am officially beneath the required GPA necessary to keep my scholarship. 

Aside from the food courtesy of the funeral, I haven't had a decent meal in maybe a month due to stress, finals, and lack of cooking skills. I would like to have a few days where I don't worry about hunger.

She still has two pre-teen children at home, and works incredibly hard.  Hopefully I can be a positive influence to everyone now that I am living with my fam.

Even though I didn't work over the past few years, I have had some great experiences that really started to give me direction.  I am lucky enough to be able to live at home now, and go back to school.  My goal is to get back into a University in a years time, study in intnat'l business and economics and live in Europe for a while (I love to be the foreigner and there is so much to see!).

Story: I'm a freelance theater artist, and I depend upon a steady stream of checks from my various performing and teaching gigs to stay afloat. However, this week two theaters where I teach failed to send my payment, and while I've worked it out to have those missed payments added in a few weeks, I'm currently down to $10 to last me for food for the next two weeks!

"Hello! :)

My roommate is a 19-year old college student who has a beautiful baby girl (who was born while he was still in high school).  The mother is a year younger and takes care of her while he is at our apartment for university - but he heard today that his baby is sick and in the hospital.  He can't miss class, so he's stuck hours away from his baby in our apartment worried sick.

In addition, while riding on a bus to class, he took his keys out (it was about to storm) and put them in his hands to get into his car immediately after exiting the bus.  He left the bus, but apparently forgot his keys, and had to wait outside as it stormed for the bus to loop around (takes anywhere from 20 minutes to 45), then found out that the keys somehow made their way onto ANOTHER BUS, so he had to go back to campus, chase down the bus they were on, and finally get home.  All during a storm.

I'm broke for a few days until I get some money, and I'll definitely pay it forward down the line when I have some money to spend, but if someone could spare a few dollars and help get my roommate's week back on track, I'd love you forever.

Just got my helmet and gauntlets in today. Just excited to share, not really relevant.

 I haven't ordered a pizza in the 2 years I've been in Ames.  I just don't like the idea of a poor guy driving a pizza out to me and feel obligated to tip well.  Unfortunately I don't have much money so I don't order pizza.

That didn't stop me from buying a bike 0_o.  I only eat once a day, usually dinner after I get done working all day.  It doesn't bother me, in-fact my stomach is tiny now and I don't even notice I'm hungry.

I might go take a nap but I've always heard about this subreddit but missing the domino's pizza contest made me hungry for pizza, it'll subside after a day or 2 I hope but in the mean-time I wanted to post.

I went from 6'1 186 pounds (still skinny) to 163 pounds apparently this not eating stuff is really good at cutting weight.  I was trying to put on weight (muscle) though.  Pizza doesn't really help with that though, don't know why I have a craving for it.

Both the pizza end of things and other areas.  I had no idea about reddit.  This Random Acts of Pizza is truly amazing to follow.

I've been hesitant to post because while I'm in a tough spot, it lacks in comparison to so many others.  I finally decided I'd just give it a try.  Worse case scenario, I don't get a pizza.  That's where I am anyway :)

I've been married for almost 10 years.  My wife and I have two beautiful children, a daughter 5, and a son 6.  When I met my wife, I was working crazy hours and didn't always have time for everything we wanted, but Friday night was always our date night.  It started purely by accident when she invited me over for pizza and a movie one night, and we've kept the tradition alive all these years.  We used to go out to the movies, and when that got too expensive, we enjoyed a movie at home.  When the kids got older, date night was expanded to family night.  Pizza and a movie for everyone.  We've gone through a lot of things in the last few years.  It's often felt like one step forward and two steps back.  We're still moving though.  Still fighting.  There came a point where pizza became a luxury, and it's something we've accepted and moved on.  I laugh when people talk about discretionary income.  We've learned to shave a lot of corners and given up a lot of things just to pay the bills.  

Anyway, I guess my request is this.  I would love to, just for one night, be able to surprise the family with our pizza tradition.  They deserve it, and I wish I could give it to them.

I'm sure above me and below me are probably posts of people that need it more than we do, and I say give it to them.  If someone knows what it's like to be in this place and wants to help out, it would be much appreciated.

I look forward to the day I can come on here and make someone's day.  No promises of when I'll be able to do that, but I can promise it will happen, and I will be spreading the word about this and hope that more people will offer help to those who need it.

"First, i want to say WOW! I had no idea something like this existed. I've helped people on the street with meals before but this is something beautifully different. 

I am a young woman living with my longtime boyfriend and like a lot of people, times are tough. I had a temporary lay off with my job that i just went back to but wont be receiving a paycheck until next Friday. My boyfriend wont be paid from his work until the 6th. Had dental work done recently that took about 190 bucks to fix my teeth. I used my last can of chili beans and mixed it with white rice last night for dinner. Many nights we go without dinner(sometimes i survive on cups of coffee all day) but we never lose sight that things will get better for us eventually. We are in the middle class rut; don't make enough to survive comfortably in California but are making too much money for food assistance. It leaved us caught in a limbo. Ive been to a local food pantry once before and yes, it was hard to keep your chin up and have that pride when you are asking for help from someone. 

It seems easier to ask for help if its done semi-anonymously as I don't have to shamefully look anyone in the eye who may judge me. I would love a pizza for dinner and with the leftovers, eat for breakfast and lunch. We live in Union City, California in the shadows of both the great Silicon Valley and the San Fransisco Bay. Right smack in the middle where apartments are tiny but cost you an arm and a leg to live there. 

Thank you guys for taking the time to create such a wonderful service to help your fellow man. I WILL be paying it forward when i get on my feet, if only a simple pie to a struggling family. 

email me at l0serl0ve7@gmail.com if you could help us. If you need proof of something lemme know, i can screenshot my dentist check that cleared or my negative account balance. Thanks again.

My backstory:
I'm a 24 year old single dad with full custody of my 5 year old. Things have been really tight for years..pretty much since I graduated high school. I pay for everything on my own and between rent, car payment, utilities, groceries, and a $440 daycare bill every month there isn't much left. His mother chips in $75/month which doesn't even pay for a week of daycare. 

Anyway, my son starts elementary school next week and is scared to death. Would love to surprise him with a pizza :]

"Hey there, I am going hungry and would really appreciate a pizza from anyone willing. I'll give a little story about what has led me to be extremely poor (£9 to last until the end of August).

I went to university this year, and moved out of my parent's home to forge a new life in Peckham, which is when everything started going horribly wrong. I hated my course, the people on my course seemingly went out of their way to make me feel uncomfortable (I'm quite shy, and very insecure).

For years now, I've been fighting my demons, keeping them just below the surface - I've always felt like I was just about floating, reading to sink at any moment. Around Christmas, I did just that - sank like a stone. I fell into a major depressive episode that last months, culminating in what I can only describe as a mental breakdown over Easter. I became dependent on weed, never leaving my room or spending time sober other than to go to work on Sundays, and then I'd come home and get high again. Obviously, I dropped out of university.

This, obviously, was a massive waste of money. It also didn't help that I'd lent one of my now ex-housemates £100 to help him pay his rent, which I know now that I will never see again (we live and learn). I have a £970 overdraft that is all gone, and although I've at least paid my rent for this month, I won't be getting paid until the end of August. I also have to pay a week worth of council tax (only £30 but too much for me) for the week before I enrolled, or I'll have a court date, and £40 of library fees tomorrow, but luckily my mum is bailing me out for that (she already bailed me out of last month's rent, so I already owe her £500).

I've had to start working full time, eat butter sandwiches at work because it is all I can afford, and improvise for dinner (or just not eat). I'm extremely skinny anyway, and cannot afford this weight loss.

I spend four hours commuting a day (I work in West London), come home, eat, sleep, get up at 6am to go to work again...I feel very lonely at the moment, and a cheesy, greasy pizza with meat or something would go a long way to providing me with a little comfort at the moment.

Sorry for spilling this all out, I only meant to give a short sum out, but have ended up providing you with an essay! I'm not known for being concise...

But yes, a pizza would be so very appreciated, and if the offerer wanted, I can return the pizza favour once I get paid. I would just like some meat and cheese in my life right now haha. Thanks for listening &lt;3",False

Hi reddit. This is my first time ever doing something like this but here I go.

I am requesting a pizza to feed two adults in Westminster MD. My fiancé and i are behind because I broke my ankle in July and have been out of work since because the break required extensive surgery. All pizza chains are equally distant and would require us to pick up.

We have maybe $20 to our name and he has a full work schedule next week as well as having to take me to a follow up appointment with my surgeon on Monday, who is located a thirty minute drive away.

We've been eating a lot of PBJs and ramen and our ramen is running out so a pizza could really help out a lot. When we have gotten two pizzas in the past,they have lasted us for three-four days.

"Hey everyone, I feel weird for posting this, but we're desperate. So, here it goes.

My girlfriend, **MuchToTheDutch**, and I both recently got jobs after three months of being unemployed new arrivals to Austin. This is awesome,but we started our jobs the 27th of June and we got paid through the 30th. This basically meant that we had just barely enough to cover our rent and bills. We've been living off rice, beans, ramen, and pasta for the last 10 or 11 days and we have to stretch it until next Monday when we get paid.  We haven't even been eating lunch; it's down to a meal a day at this point.

If some awesome person could hook us up with a pizza tonight, it would completely make our day. We'll pay it back two fold come Monday and post a follow up thread that day too.

Thanks,

**TexanInExile**

"**EDIT: NEVER MIND! Since we couldn't hang out, my girlfriend made me and delivered dinner! Here's my sob story anyway**

I never really did this before so I'm not sure how it works, and from the looks of how many people are posting and asking for pizza, I probably wont get any, but it's worth a go. My grandfather has been in the hospital for a week and my mom just went in this morning because she has pneumonia. My dad, who is still in the middle of work, just drove my sister to her soccer game and is going to visit my grandpa, then to visit my mom in a different hospital, then going back to work. He came home for a half hour and he said I can't leave the house because I have SATs tomorrow morning and no one can come over because no one is home. When he left he told me we have nothing to eat and to buy my own food tonight and he'll pay me back. I just checked my wallet and I remembered I just spend my only $20 to buy a prepaid card to buy a game on Steam last night and I'm kind of regretting that now. Now I'm stuck here alone for two hours until my sister gets a ride home from her soccer game and who knows when my dad will be home. No matter what time he gets home, I still wont be able to eat. So all I'm asking for is a small pizza for one so I can eat tonight.

TL;DR: Grandpa and my mom are in the hospital. My dad drove my sister to her soccer game then has to visit two different hospitals before going back to work. Home alone. Can't buy pizza because I bought a game last night with the last of my money.",False

"Hello, people. 

I was just told about this subreddit by a friend after venting to him about this evenings biggest annoyance. I've taken part in pizza sharing things before, I just honestly never knew there was a subreddit for it. My favourite time anything like that happened was this one time me and a friend spent _forever_ calling anywhere we could find in this small Czech town, trying to order pizza for a mutual friend we knew online, but that's a long and HILARIOUS tale involving calling the _Mayor_ even, and I'll gladly share it if folk want to hear it.

Anyway, my issue, sob story, whatever you wanna call it.

Basically I live with a flatmate in a really crappy part of the northwest UK, and this guy I share my space with is a presumptuous ass. It's not uncommon to find he's 'borrowed' something of mine, not cleaned after himself if he used the kitchen/bathroom/toilet/anything, and a favourite trick of his seems to be eating my food when he thinks I'm not in or asleep. 
That happened tonight. I come in from a day out with family and open the fridge, I'd been planning on making a veritable bathtub full of chilli to eat and freeze in for the next few days until my payday, however tonight I get to learn that he's had company over and guess what he made for these upstanding citizens! He basically used _everything_ I had left, _everything_, to feed his drugdealer friends as they came over to smoke weed, be loud, and play/watch whatever happens to be ridiculously loud in the next room over. One pointless shouting match later I'm sat here tired, wet, and hungry enough that I'd happily eat my bed. Spoke with the family I _just_ came from about this and I'm invited back over for dinner on Friday, the day prior to my payday. Still leaves me foodless tonight and tomorrow, though, and a friend pointed me here. I already said that. Um.

I've no idea of etiquette here, I've no idea if I said too little or not enough, but hey there's my request. I will say though that I'm probably gonna stick around here, and will definitely pass on the favour to somebody elses request once I'm paid. Share the love and such.",False

"So I had a phenomenal day on Friday, I have to tell you all about it. 

I went into work and was called into the office of the Manager who runs the whole establishment, mind you I've never even spoken to the man. He begins grilling me about some sensitive information I had leaked and wants to know how I found out. I have two choices, give him a name, or be fired.

What was the information? Well I asked the sous chef's mother how her daughter was doing after not getting the job. Apparently no one knew she hadn't gotten it yet somehow I did.

How did I find this information out? A random conversation with a co-worker about who the new chef is going to be.

Nothing fishy in the whole thing. I was going through my day-to-day work life without a care in the world and bam, I'm in my boss's, boss's, boss's office under the microscope being pushed for a name and I couldn't for the life of me remember who told me what seemed to be such trivial information. So just like that I got the hammer.

I somehow took the news alright. I mean, I was definitely plotting my revenge on ""the man"" and making plans to build my own corporation that would ravage their puny establishment until it begged to be put out of it's misery, but my head was up and my spirits were high.

I drove out of the parking lot and hit the job hunt immediately. Which lasted all of about 30 minutes when it ended abruptly and I found myself underneath a 2006 Dodge Charger. 

The driver, not wanting to waste the precious moments of their ever important life, decided to skip the traffic at a stop light by driving up the shoulder and wound up directly on top of me, totaling my bike.

So now we're at the present moment. I'm on my 5th day of leg elevated bed lock down, the bills are still coming in, and the hunger is rumbling.

"Let's be honest, who wants to leave the house with an ace bandage around their head and stitches that look like spiders on their face? 

I had surgery on my neck Tuesday, and my neck and face are covered in bruises. I've managed to stay inside for since then, and hope a few more days will help with the situation. 

I don't mind sending a verification pic of the bruising to any of you kind folks, and hope to return the kindness of yummies sometime soon.

Thank you for taking  the time to look, either way!

"EDIT: I have been offered pizza for my family, THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!

I'm really not sure how to do this, I've been lurking for awhile and signed up last night and my email is verified.

My husband started a new job at the beginning of last month, they pretty much promised the ""world"" to get him in the door. This hasn't happened, instead it's brought us further to the bottom. We made a whole $500 last month and it's not better this month either. He's talking about getting a lawyer because, he hasn't been paid for everything he's done and paid way less than promised. No, we didn't get anything in writing and that is one piece of evidence we don't have for a lawyer.

I applied for foodstamps on the 23rd of last month. They said they would be expedited but, then said (today on the phone) that since we did have that money last month then they have until after the 20th of this month to finish my case. They said they are unsure of the info on the wage form from his employer. Well, I haven't seen it since they faxed it to eachother and my worker is out until Monday. I spoke to a supervisor and didn't really get any words in.

Anyways, our bills are not all paid so the $212 (Yes, that was his pay deposited in the bank!) today had to go towards the bills. My husband is a truck driver and I'm applying for financial aid to go back to college.

We are a family of 4 and would love to request pizza for tonight. Yes, I know that I am new. I cannot offer contribution of funds, gift cards or whatever but, I can offer things locally and posted an offer of a full garbage bag of clothing/shoes for a little girl in the assistance section. We are behind on our internet/phone so it will be shut off soon, that is why we still have internet access or else I'd have to use the library in town.

I'm unsure of how this works, please bare with me. We are rural, they don't deliver out here. There is a Pizza hut, Dominos and a Hunts brothers in a local country diner.

I want to make sure everyone knows that my kids will NOT starve tonight if they don't get pizza. We have a few odds and ends and I would never, ever let them starve. I'd find a way to get them food before letting that happen. I'll also be visiting the pantry for the 1st time on Tuesday.

I'll be upfront, this is a throwaway account.  I've got a little too much pride still to let people really know how bad of a situation I'm in.

To be blunt, my life sucks right now.  My wife left me about a year ago, the woman I've been seeing is now with one of my closest friends, I just lost my job 4 months ago, and the temp work just isn't out there.

The high point of my life right now is my little boy.  He's the best thing to come out of my marriage, I would do anything in the world for him.

This is why I'm coming to you Reddit.  My wife is bringing him back tomorrow, and I would love to be able to surprise him with some pizza.  The sad fact is though, I can't afford it.  Which is why I'm coming to you guys.

A little background: I had to take a hardship withdrawal last spring and drop out of college when I lost my dining hall job. I managed to get a new job at a call center in town that is ""always hiring"" and that's been pretty decent, but not quite enough to pay the bills and pay for food.

I'm attempting to go back to school so I don't have to pay my student loans back, especially since the call volume is dropping at the center and I haven't been getting the best hours. 
According to the government I make too much money to qualify for food stamps, and my dad makes too much money for me to qualify for Pell Grant. My car has been spazzing out and I think it's probably on it's last legs, and today I didn't even make conversion at work for the month, so I don't get any bonuses.
Overall everything's just been a bit rough, I definitely plan on paying it forward as soon as I get everything together. One of my landlords wants me to dogsit for a couple weeks or so next month, and I'll be able to cover everything then.

I've heard great things about this subreddit and was hoping someone would help me out. 

Had my hours cut at work, got paid last week only to spend it all by sunday catching up on bills.

And Now the car's engine won't even kick over. 

Stomach is growling and I have nothing but dry cereal ( which is something some people can't say I know. )  So I'm hoping one of you kind people will help me fill my belly.

"I know I am in no way original or the most deserving of a pizza, but basically, here's my story:
I met a girl awhile ago. We'll refer to her as an 80's metal musician. Let's say, Dave Mustaine. Dave and I started talking over a social media site, but for vagueness, we'll say headnovel. We met in real life shortly after, and became the best of friends very fast. About 3 months into hanging out, my ex-girlfriend called me while we were hanging out at my cabin, and I got upset because the ex was saying terrible things. To rectify this, Dave thought she should kiss me, and she did. Things went from best friends to Relationship pretty fast. But Dave had a boyfriend she never saw. Literally, NEVER. He asked her out, and from then on, it was a textual relationship. Eventually, I told her she needed to decide between the two of us, but she said she didn't want to hurt him. So I cut it off. Fast forward a few months ago, she came back into my life with a different boyfriend, one she actually saw. I wanted to hang out with her again because she saw eye to eye with me on more things than last time, which was a lot. She frequents reddit and other such sites, we laugh at memes and dumb things, hate everyone that is ignorant, we appreciate good music, and are very emotional. This time, reddit, she took my virginity while she was emotionally with her new boyfriend. I didn't regret it at first. I do now. Dave was made to choose between us once more, and she chose her boyfriend yet again. But for some dumb reason, I still talked to her up until about 24 hours ago. I wanted to fix it, to wait for this girl that I thought was the girl of my dreams. I still want to fix it. But she just hurts me. All day, I've tried to act normal, like hang out with friends and such, and I just feel removed from it. I just want some comfort food and to listen to punk music and be the stereotypical heartbroken teenage boy.
TL;DR girl of my dreams breaks my heart and virginity and I would like some comfort food right now.

I'll pay it forward however you ask, if I can.

Hello fellow Redditors. I'm probably gonna rant and make a bigger deal of this than I should, and I'll try to keep it short and simple. But let me mention, I am NOT one to ask for assistance. But there comes times when we must swallow our pride.

I have a small family of three, just my daughter, my wife, and myself. I'm a mechanic by trade, and make an acceptable amount of money...normally. The last month has been very rough, with work being slow and hours being cut. We are in an apartment that costs us $325/wk, and that is killing us. We've had to cut off both phones, and recently our car took a turn for the worst and left us without transportation.

I've been able to keep food in the house, up until the last week or so. Mostly thanks to foodstamps, but those funds have run out. This last week I've had to pay back some small debts to my boss and father, and it's really hurt.

Also, our stove at this apartment doesn't work, so we've had to basically resort to microwave, cold prep foods, and a single burner hotplate. My cupboards and fridge are empty, short of some month old ice cream and leftovers that we've been too lazy to throw away. My family is hungry, but just for the day.

So here is my request, which I will counter with an offer. In exchange for a pizza, I will buy 2 other people in need a pizza in the near future. This is my way of setting aside the guilt of asking, and expanding the assistance of RAOP. I can provide any and all proof and verification needed. And whatever happens, I'd still like to thank RAOP for all their awesomeness.

NOTE: Come Monday, I can get my paycheck advanced to me. Yesterday we just barely slid by, and all will be well from Moday on. I've got a second job that I start Tuesday at. It's just rather...depressing(maybe even desperate) feeling to be hungry, have an empty wallet, and feel like there is nothing I can do. Thanks again Reddit. :)

"New to Reddit, guys on 4Chan sent me this way so hopefully I strike a cord with someone. To sum it all up, here's the general overview of my life since April of this year.

 I used to work for a major cell phone carrier answering calls from the general public. I liked my 9 dollars an hour, then they fired me, for taking 3 days off in a row because I couldn't get to work (I couldn't miracle up a car to drive while mine was getting fixed). Seems unlikely right? Well this is Sprint we're talking about, the same people who offer to take $25 off your bill when you call to complain about their wonderful service. They don't bother to tell you it extends your contract by a year and removes your upgrade eligibility, and if you ask odds are they'll lie about it. Speaking from experience, 90% of my coworkers in my department didn't know that. So as you can tell nothings beneath them. If you have any questions about Sprint I'll happily clear them up, there's a way around almost anything lol.

I've tried my best to be self supportive up until now. I cut a few yards every month, sold all my worldly possessions, I even defaulted on my car payments with just 4 to go. You know, the usual stuff. I also tried the unusual, for a week I was selling male enhancement pills from home in my spare time. Then the company went under lol. Just as well, they were nothing but banana peel powder and saccharin anyway. Oh and crab shells or some crap like that, I dunno, I didn't keep the bottle they gave me.

My family's been real supportive through all this, my uncle even changed his phone number without telling me. Ironically I hadn't even asked for anything from them, they saw my post on twitter and deserted me on the spot. I'm the only one in the family who owns his own home, and the only one who hasn't begged the grandparents for anything. After all, I've always managed on my own, so my uncle probably figures I can do it again. Of coarse when his mule faced wife wanted a tummy tuck and a boob job done last year, they asked me to keep her in my prayers. Fair weather family is like that, thank goodness I'm the youngest. I take solace in that I'll be alive and dragging my butt on their graves long after they're dead. Might even take a wizz, gotta water the grass ya know?

Since I got fired I don't get unemployment, and I'm a natural born tax paying citizen living near a major metropolitan city, so there isn't any government programs I qualify for either. Work prospects are bleak at best, especially since now I'm without wheels. I tried doing the day labor gigs they have down at the local employment office, line was already a hundred people long when I got their, 3 hours early x.x Tried finding religion to see if the divine spirit would help with any of my problems, then I found out God gives you hardships to make you stronger. Sure enough my gas stove died later that week, so as these and countless other things continue to stack up I find myself getting stronger and stronger. You can't tell because of this fat exterior but man, underneath all that I'm built like a brick house.

So that's some of it, if I got into all of it we'd be here all day. I just want a couple bucks worth of pizza or maybe a couple of those sandwiches Dominos makes, that'd greatly improve my mood here in the short term. Tomorrow and Thursday I'll be glued to the phone hoping that for the first time since April I'll get offered a job. If nothing else wish me luck on that. Also if anyone's interested in buying whatever curse I've been afflicted with I'm selling it on the cheap =)",False

I come before you now as a humble man. I would like to think I am an honest man so I shall tell you an honest tale. 

My name is Dave and I currently am working at a Homeless shelter for homeless youth in Seattle called ROOTS. I love working at ROOTS, I can sleep easily in the mornings (since I work throughout the nights) knowing that I am helping keeping 30 homeless youth off the streets and away from SNOWzilla's wrath as he stomps through Seattle. 

SNOWzilla has ruined things here in Seattle. Because of the nature of the place I work at, someone MUST be on staff every night, and I have to work throughout the weekend and since the buses are closed? I must walk 5 miles in ice and snow to get to work. 

Sadly though, I don't get paid very much. [(Bank Statement)](http://imgur.com/DvEeh) But that is the way of the world working for a homeless shelter. I haven't eaten in the last day and a half because of there being nothing in my kitchen [My fridge](http://imgur.com/05ffR) and stores being closed.

So I am asking you all, if you are willing, would be able to show a snowed-in man with no money some kindness? Even under these difficult times, and even if whether or not my ask for some kindness has no results, know that I have fun even when times are grim [I did it all for you, Reddit!](http://imgur.com/bhnxu)

I hope you can all find it in your hearts to give some kindness my way. I hope you all have a SAFE time as snowzilla causes havoc in everyone's regions and I live you with one last picture.

"Not sure if this is the purpose of this reddit. Please excuse the new account, I saw this on the news, what an amazing idea!

I am currently living with a roommate who has just moved out of her mother's house, she has no job and her mother sends her utility and rent money. Her only responsibility is to send her mom the rent bill, and she sends half of that or pays half to the company. The problem is that this girl is SO lazy, can't be bothered to send the bills, can't be bothered to call her mom for rent and I'm under the impression she told her mom she already had a job (her mom has been chiding her for not having a job), so her mother does not feel obligated to pay this girl's bills. I have been carrying the weight of the major bills, such as electricity and rent (2x), and my paycheck is being stretched thin. To top it off, it's obvious to see where she gets her flaky attitude from...her mother REFUSES to answer my phone calls or emails. So here I am reddit, living with a girl who labels her food in the fridge so I don't touch it, and for the sake of keeping the peace...I am down to begging for a pizza X(.

"I'm intimidated to ask for food like this, but my husband works five days a week to support the two of us and our puppy.

This week he received a vacation for all of the days he's gone in early or when it was his day off and we've been waiting for Thursday (he gives plasma Thurs/Sat) for a night to finally have money for some good food.

On his way home from the Biolife center a few minutes ago he called me and said he was stuck at a gas station because he tried using the Biolife card to get gas. The pump automatically charges a card $75 dollars, I believe, and then puts back whatever you didn't use. My husband pulled the pump out to use it, realized the car was too far back, and put the pump back to pull the car forward. Somehow by doing that something got cancelled and the money is being withheld. When he called the card company they said it could be up to 7 days before it goes back into the account. My husband had to call his boss and ask if he could use the business card for $3 in gas to get home that he'd pay back Monday.

It would be so amazing if someone would provide us that awesome Thursday night we had planned. The favor *will* be returned by Saturday when he gives plasma again! We've never done this so if you're willing to walk us through how to go about receiving and then giving back when able it would be greatly appreciated!

We have a portable AC in one room but it's working hard today and I'm still rather miserable.

"Hey RAoP. I've been pretty down lately, some dark thoughts been going through my head, I think a big part of that is my uncle (whom I live with) is suspected of having Bladder Cancer. I can't describe to you or put into context how unfortunate this is for our family, I mean cancer is usually horrible but on top of the hardship our family is facing this is absolutely devastating. My uncle, my mother, and me are supported by my grandmother. We all live in the same fairly small house, I'm the only one who has a (low wage retail) job and I'm working there and going to school so that soon I can get out of here alive, things are so stressful here. I usually wake up to people arguing and yelling at each other, my car needs a new transmission, I need tons of dental work, I really don't feel like going on a lot of the time but I stay positive and just try to reflect on the fact that I am working and making good grades.

So, I hope that didn't bore you, I didn't get too detailed. As for a pizza, if someone feels like getting me one that would be cool as I am broke until Friday, and we don't have much food here, also we have roaches so a lot of the food is contaminated. Ugh.

"Hey RAoP

This is a throwaway account but I'd be happy to PM you from my real account as verification. I've given before and never received.

First up I'd like to say that pizza is NOT necessary and we won't starve without it. Not even a bit. We've got some leftovers in the freezer and a bunch of odds and ends in the cupboards and even a bunch of friends who'd take us out to dinner or have us over if we asked (but we'd feel bad asking because we're old enough to be meant to be beyond this!). So, absolutely no worries if no-one can give. 

I'm asking because a bunch of unexpected grown up expenses just ambushed us. My boyfriend's grandfather died unexpectedly and we wanted to go to the funeral - but it was 5 hours away and we didn't have a car. So we bought a cheap car and made it to the funeral, but it turns out that car ownership is super expensive. Rego is nearly $1000! Add insurance, NRMA membership (needed cos we weren't sure whether our little bomb of a car would make the drive and we didnt want to be stranded in the australian outback forever), random fees for vehicle inspections and more random fees just for existing add up to be the value of the car again! What. The. Hell. (yes, I *have* lived a sheltered life, thank you for asking.)

Add that to the billion and one other things we're saving up for/need to pay (rent, bills, house deposit, wedding, honeymoon maybe, helping our families) and it's come as a bit of a shock to our financial system :P
We literally have $0.67 in the bank and a bit of change in cash until pay day. This is an odd and disconcerting feeling. 

What would pizza mean to us? Laughter and joy. The pleasure of knowing that there are good people who care about strangers. A memory to carry with us both when things are hard and when things are good and we can give again. A small easing of financial stress for the next few days. 

I might also pull the request later because like I said - it's most definitely not a do or die type situation. And anyway, my credit card's taken such a pounding this week, what harm is pizza going to do? :P

But thanks for reading anyway, RAoP!

Also, please and thank you ;)",False

There's a really messed up situation and I haven't even told my dad about this yet, so I don't want my friends or cousins finding out yet either because they can't keep their mouths shut.

I got a surprise yesterday when a guy I've never even met greets me in the hallway of my apartment building and tells me he wants me to leave my girlfriend of 2 years. My girlfriend then confronts us both and gives me the shock of my life, she's been cheating on me with this guy, and she's pregnant, but she's 90% certain neither of us is the father! She was cheating on me with this guy, and cheating on him with someone else. I've never raised a hand to a girl and never will, I was raised better than that, but I've never been more tempted in my life to haul back and deck someone!

After a two hour conversation with this dude I find out she hasn't been working for a whole year. He's been paying our electric and water since we moved into the apartment! She goes over to his house almost daily when she left me to head to work. Some days she leaves and neither of us could account for where she was. My girlfriend of 2 years is a lady of the night and has been milking 3 guys, me included and maybe more than just us, for everything we've got for years!

I'm at my bros house and he's been very tolerant of all this, real step up kind of guy to take me in because I've been living with this tramp for over a year now, I got no place else to go right now. I need something to eat because neither of us has any money and he's living off noodles right now. I'll happily pay it forward on the 8th when I get paid. But for today, I need something better than noodles or black beans and rice, and I think he would appreciate it too.

When I asked my dad if I could go shopping with him he said he didn't have the money to feed all these people and asked the women with the 2 daughters to find a place. It feels like it's been forever and they are still here. There's almost nothing I can make to eat besides ramen and corn. The only thing she buys is junk food but not even anything you would want to eat as a snack. Ice creme, ice creme cake, microwave dinners which I can't eat because it's for her ""diet"", and baby food.

What I've been doing is just going out and eating but I quit my last job and began to work with my father. It was hard work and good pay but we live in Florida and it's rain so much the past few days we haven't been able to work and he hasn't giving me a paycheck. Like I said there is corn, ramen, and ice creme I CAN eat. I really rather not but if you are generous enough to give someone a pizza, try and find someone in more need than I am. If you can't and decide to help me out I will LOVE YOU!

Thanks for reading and I'll answer any questions.

TL;DR: Guest who've been staying at my house eat everything and leave me nothing. Haven't left after being asked to. I'm terrible at writing.

NVM! My mother invited me over to dinner and to pick me up as well. (parents are divorced)

"Hi, not something I have done ever, but here it goes.

I got done with my exams 2 weeks ago and wasn't able to work as much as I would have wanted to during this past 30 days, after paying off my rent all my bills, I have just been left enough money for the bus fare to and from work for the next week and I can't spend that, I've got some rice and bread and PB and stuff, but that's only enough to last me a few days, so I was wondering if anyone could buy me a papa johns? That would be a nice fulfilling meal for a change.

Since I get paid in 8 days, i.e next Friday, I promise to pass the pizza love to someone who need's it like I do now, I guess that's the whole point of this subreddit.

Anyway, thanks for reading.

"Hello fellow redditors. I will be very honest, I am one of the people who have come here after seeing the media coverage. Well I have been here before, but mostly just lurking. I haven't been able to afford much for myself lately, so that's why I haven't really participated much here, but it is something I plan on doing once I get some more funds in the bank account.

So here's my story. Tomorrow is one of my really good friends 23rd birthday. It's been a rough year so far for both of us (both had breakups around the same time) and since then, our friendship has really become a lot stronger. I've been in the negatives in my bank account the last two weeks and I can't afford to get him anything for his birthday (it's a byob party and I don't even have any b to b) He's having about 6 or so people over tomorrow to celebrate and I think it would be awesome if we could get some birthday pizza for the party. I know there's a lot of people out there who would better benifit from pizza, but this would mean a whole lot to me if someone could help me out tomorrow evening. I'll pay it forward when I can afford!",False

"Hey reddit, longtime redditor here.. lurked for a few years then signed up about a year ago. Been going through some rough times lately. My mother passed exactly a year ago this week (February 13th, 2011), due to colon cancer at the young age of 55, sadly I cannot make it to her grave today to tell her how much I miss her, but I'm not much for hanging around dead bodies anyway, the soul has moved on and I'm almost positive she's someplace nicer. Me and my father haven't been getting along either, he is an alcoholic, anger-ridden man.. Ana and I couldn't afford our last apartment so we tried moving in with him, to help him with bills and whatnot, and he constantly berated me. I'm not sure why he is the way he is, but I think it has something to do with his mother. When I was 12 I was a lot heavier than the other kids and she would tell me about it, in the meanest possible ways. So I'm pretty sure that's where he gets it from. Suffice it to say, living with him without my kind and compassionate mom to stop him from getting so angry was nothing short of terrible. Ana kept telling me how badly we needed to save up and get out of there, we were there for a week and then it got really bad when he found we took 2 plates of food up to our room. He started screaming and calling me names like always, telling us that we're no longer welcome, telling us to pack our bags and basically to live on the street... then I decided to be clever (sarcasm) and call him a ""dick""  since he found it okay to call me every terrible name in the book, BAD move. I don't know how he heard me from the hallway, but he did. He slammed the door open, knocking over Ana's desktop computer, knocking over the desk it was set up on, and also knocking her over into our bed. He grabbed me by the throat and threw me up against the wall and started choking me out, much to Ana's dismay, she was crying and screaming at him the whole time, telling him to stop and let me go, trying to pull him off of me. Afterwards he offered us a ride to the shelter because we had her computer and all of our clothes.. we declined the offer. This was her idea. Then she gave me the best advice I have ever gotten concerning my father. Leave. Leave and never look back. He is not safe to be around. He is not a good person. So to say we've hit quite a rough patch is somewhat of an understatement. I'm not sure if this was all TMI but I really just feel a whole lot better getting it off of my chest. Ana is my hero, she really is, she is beautiful and she makes me feel like I'm actually worth caring about. If you've read this far, thank you so much.

But alas! Some good news! We both just landed new jobs yesterday. We both got hired as sales people at Sears... I know not much, but for around here it's pretty much the best we can find. I'm an IT guy, actually I'm more of a helpdesk-break/fix-troubleshooter sort of guy but I also have worked IT jobs. We do what we can to be happy and this area doesn't have many jobs so we're trying our best. We don't have a car (in a town where the buses don't even run on sunday or after 5pm any day, no joke- [www.lctabus.com/](www.lctabus.com/)) and we spent every last penny on rent. In fact, we still haven't paid our security deposit, luckily the landlord is a good lady and is understanding of our situation. So clearly there is no money for pizza. Which is upsetting, since pizza just so happens to be our favorite food, hands down. If someone can be help, we'll be sure to share it with our little puppy Horatio, who is the most adorable dog in the world,  he just turned 3 on valentines day! Here's a picture of me and him: ([Horatio and Bill](http://i.imgur.com/ohDJi.jpg)) , and for good measure here is a picture of my girlfriend/his mommy: ([Ana](http://i.imgur.com/qHmZL.jpg)) . Anyway... we will be sure to take pictures and post them, as long as they come out nice and she doesn't hate the way she looks in them. Either way we will be sure to make some sort of post thanking you. She's actually at orientation right now and I've got online training to do. Thank god we still have the internet! We're so damn lucky that one of our neighbors has unprotected wi-fi, otherwise we wouldn't get our daily Reddit fix.

I was with my girlfriend on her 18th birthday and she really wanted to go down to the arcade. We're a new couple, so of course I'm trying to look cool in front of her so I say something along the lines of ""Alright, if you really want to,"" when really I wanted to shout at the top of my excitement ""ARE YOU SURE IT'S YOU'RE BIRTHDAY AND NOT MINE BECAUSE I LOVE THE ARCADE, WOOOOO--""


So we're at the arcade playing these goofy silly games, like the game where you put a quarter in and you watch your quarter go down into a pile of quarters and there is a metal bar that just might push more quarters down into the prize pit and ANYWAY, we're having fun.


So she eventually has to go to the little girl's room and she forgets to bring her phone. I took her phone and started counting up our tickets when all of a sudden her phone gets a text and a picture of her best friend's face pops up on the screen. I don't like to go through other peoples texts, but I see the word ""Tony"" before I put the phone back in my pocket, which is my first name.
So I read just the 1 text. It states:
""Tony better remember what you asked for last week.""
My stomach got this twisted feeling of ""oh crap how could I forget."" 


!!!!! 


JUST THEN --- A pizza delivery guy from the pizza place right next door is walking out to his car about to leave, so I rush him and scream ""hey wait!"". I ask him what kind of pizza, how much was it, and paid him in full plus a 10$ tip. I asked him to hold the pizza for a minute, and ran across the street to the joke shop and bought a gag sausage (don't ask me why there was one there, I wasn't paying attention at the time.)


I took the gag sausage back to the pizza, took out my pocket knife, and cut up a slice small enough to look similar to a pepperoni. Next, I took a pen and paper and wrote a note and pinned it down with a candle on top and just then, she's walks out of the bathroom and I start singing happy birthday. People around the room joined in and we all clapped for her as she blew out the candle.


She has this ear to ear smile that is to die for. She gave me a fairly large 'thank you' kiss and said ""I thought you forgot!"".


She took the note off of the fake pepperoni and read it. ""I will love you until the last pepperoni fades."" she starting crying like she just won the lottery.

---- Now, fast forwarding 5 years later, we are still happily together and enjoying our youth, but her birthday is today and I plan to have dinner with her this evening.

Would also be willing to assist someone in simple or perhaps slightly complicated HTML/CSS work if requested. I'm sure I can find a little bit of time to answer questions or give advice. That's pretty much my forte. Just don't ask me about jQuery. That seems to be my kryptonite!",False

If someone gives me a papajohns gift card, I will use code that gives you the free pizza with an order of $10 and pay it forward in this subreddit tomorrow night!

"I am an out of work phlebotomist struggling to get by at the moment while I find another hospital to work at.  The bills are piling up and I have no money to pay them.  What bothers me the most about my situation is that my boyfriend, who is super patient and cooperative with me while i'm losing my mind trying to find a job, helps me however I need to whether it is financial or a simple hug at the end of his long day to cheer me up a bit.  I am very upset that I lost my independence...

My boyfriend has been on a diet (Keto) for a few months, and he has decided that he is going to have a ""cheat day"" on his birthday which is in a few days.

"I'm not in College, or a starving artist or anything like that. I've just been a bit unlucky lately. I'm a 36 year old single guy with a job. But rent, and other bills killed me this month.

I had a small bag of chips Wednesday afternoon, and I get paid Monday, so I'll be fine then.. It's just really painful at this point and food is something I'm constantly thinking about.

I've got a few bucks to get on the bus to work on Saturday, so I can't really use that.

"Hi! I don't consider myself particularly destitute, but some delivery, be it pizza or whatever else, would certainly be appreciated tonight. Story and circumstance below.

I work at one of my school's IT help desks. It's our fall break, and I'm here alone from 2p-10p central. Normally, I'd get a lunch break, but as I'm the only one here (no supervisor, or anything), and I don't have a key, I can't leave the office.

Delivery is fine, but I'm running low on cash until payday. A tight spot to be in this week, but I'm usually OK. When I get off, there will be campus food I can get, so it's really a matter of making it til 10pm.

"Hey guys.  This is my first request.  I live in Pittsburgh and my boyfriend's visiting for a week.  I haven't seen him since the beginning of May so I'm pretty excited, but here's the situation.

My boyfriend doesn't have a job (I do, but I get paid by the month and my first paycheck isn't coming until June 30th).  The only reason he can visit me now is because his brother is taking summer classes so that's half of the traveling cost paid.  He also sprained his ankle on Saturday meaning he's still in crutches.  Lastly (and I realize this one's mostly my fault), my mother really wants us to go with her to Lake Erie for a day and a half.  

[Following paragraph contains a lot of venting about crazy Polish mothers]

Now you may be wondering ""What's wrong with the last part"" in which I will refer you to the crutches.  Yes, I've explained to her about the crutches, that he can't and shouldn't walk very much and that he is not going to be comfortable on this trip.  I've even suggested other alternatives, like going to a free movie in the park.  The thing is, my mother is crazy and you can't argue with crazy.  Also, I'm going to have to tell my BF that apparently, he has to go because if he doesn't, I'm going to be the one getting bitched at about how my boyfriend doesn't care about me and how he's lazy.  I know I should just shake it off and deal with it but honestly, I can't change my situation RIGHT NOW so I'd prefer dealing with this as painlessly as possible.  Of course, my boyfriend seemed pretty pissed about it when I told him my mom suggested this idea so, thanks mom, you're probably going to be the cause of our first fight.

Anyway, it's gonna be a terrible few days for him and I'd like to make sure he has a tasty meal after a long trip and to say ""I'm sorry that my mom's crazy and I can't do anything about it.""  His house is in Oakland so I'd suggest Sorento (4126219129 cheap and decent quality) or Antoons (4126875446 cheaper but more meh pizza) since they are local and cheap.

Also, since I'm getting my first paycheck in June 30th, I'll make sure to donate a pizza.

"These are the reasons we NEED pizza:

1. One of our roommates is lost in a storm and we would like her to have some melty, tomatoey, cheesy goodness when (if) she survives and makes it back to our dorm.
2. One roommate is banging her head on her desk and if we had a pizza it would be a good cushion so she wouldn't hurt her head.
3. Our toes and fingers are cold and we could use the leftover pizza to warm them.
4. One roommate has an exam and is laughing hysterically. Probably to keep from crying. We think pizza would help.
5. This same roommate just announced that she had to fart. We need pizza aromas to cover up the smell of her toxic waste.
6. Lucy is lost.
7. We can't have our pet unicorn in the dorm, so we think pizza would be the next best thing to have (sloths aren't allowed, either).
8. I just needed to have one more reason so that our list would have an even number of reasons because odd numbers are gross.

But today I lost my best friend. 

My friend since fourth grade was bullied out of school in 6th, and nobody talked to him. I felt bad for him, and I stuck with him. Several years go by, and I'm still his only friend, so I convince him to come to my school, and meet my friends! So school starts, and he meets my friends, he doesn't really click with them, and decides to meet new people. A month go by, and he meets some really bad kids. Stupid kids no one else likes. Any way, I try and talk to him today, and he gives me a cold shoulder. 

When I tell him what he did wasn't cool (being an awkward homeschooler he doesn't know much about being with people), he apologizes. The bell rings, we go to class. After class him and his buddy come up to me, punch me, and run off. 

This puts me in a bad mood. I storm home. He texts ""What's wrong?"" I tell him ""You, punching me."" He then, goes on about how I'm over reacting, because I'm upset, he punched me, and I tell him to go away, not wanting to talk, and he just refuses to believe he did anything wrong.  He then argues, that ""I should just suck it up, it's your fault you're in pain, if you weren't so weak, it wouldn't have hurt!""

I then at that very moment, lose it, sh*t hits the fan. I tell him ""Screw off. We're not friends. I don't wanna be associated with a person who believe they're not ever at fault."" I haven't talk to him since. This was a few hours ago. So I'm just lost. He's one of the few people I had left.

"Hello Redditors!

Like the title says, my girlfriend and I are writing a ""How to lease your first apartment"" guide for all the new freshman and sophomores who are going to start signing leases next week. See, around here the apartment companies build up this hype that all of the best apartments will be gone if you don't sign on Oct 5th. This is such shit! We were able to both get out of really shitty leases and move into a great place halfway through the year and pay less than what . By perpetuating this myth, the leasing offices show kids shitty apartments and make them believe that these are the best ones that are ""left"" and that the students should pay $400 - $600 per PERSON for these shit holes. 

Basically, we are writing a guide for these students so they wont get screwed. I know that you guys are namely good at giving out pizza (which would be greatly appreciated) but any good advice you have for leasing an apartment is appreciated as well!

i went back to the hospital because of suicadal and depression...(Ive already been once, and this time got diagnosed with bipolar)

gave me a shit tons of medicatinos, (I find out later that were all outdated,  and all had adverse side effects with each other)
missed 3 imporant auditions (I am an actor, missed 1 theater audition and two major film auditions, batman and Avengers)'

As soon as I get released from the hospital, I get a nagging throbbing pain in my side, turns out to be a kidney stone, start pissing blood that wont stop for three week

then drove up to CPH (Cleveland Playhouse) for a callback for their first downtown show (Really big deal in Cleveland) while dealing with a kidney stone
on my way there from Parents house, which is  a two hour drive
my car broke down
so every 20 miles i had to get out, fill it up with water in the heatwave
so i just got more dehydrated which is awful for kidney stones, and just made things incredibly difficult and uncomfortable.

get there to the audition all sweaty, delarious, and dehyrdated
fucked up that audition
drove home, same 20 mile bullshit
go home, get the worst pain of my entire life, THE WORST PAIN YOU CAN EVER IMAGINE. Google Kidney stone pain.

While I was in the hospital, I lost my job, (which later turns into cutting hours) because they don't think I am ""reliable and stable"", so due to this, I can't pay rent on a new place, and my lease is up August 1st, so I have to move back home. 
Work decides to give me hours, but only 20hrs a week, and from my parents house, its over an hour and 15 min away. 
then my 2cd week back at work, i got attacked again by kidney stones
got yelled at again from my boss because I ""should have seen the stone coming and not went to work:
Go to the ER, and urologist and they tell me  i have to wait 19 days to get a CT scanto see whats wrong with my kidneys
Get  an email form my old landlord basically saying im not getting my deposit back.

And last night, TO TOP EVERYTHING OFF, someone broke into my truck.

However, since he's in another country, his credit card couldn't go through, and he was unable to place an order online. So he sent me $24 through Paypal. :)

I've been in a sort of a rough patch, and haven't had a decent meal in weeks. So I was really looking forward to having pizza for dinner on a Saturday night. Unfortunately, I found out Papa John's and Pizza Hut don't accept Paypal. 

Now I'm not sure if I'd be breaking any rules by doing this. If I am, please let me know and I'll take this down. If not, then I would be more than happy to send someone $24 through Paypal if they could order some pizza for me.

He ended up drinking and driving and drove through a fence (and then on my rims around the block). Totaled it. It was the last thing my dad gave me and I can't afford repairs nor the tow for weeks. By the time I can get it out, it will be costing more than it's worth. I am still going to get it out and fix it, because it is sentimental. All I have to eat is rice for the next three weeks (maybe more); so, I'm not starving, but a pizza would really be a pick-me-up at this point.

"Hey there fine folks of RAOP! I'm a sophomore here at Texas State University. This year has been particularly tough on me financially, but I've managed to stay afloat until now. I have a disease called Hidradenitis Suppurativa. I would not suggest google searching, unless you'd like to lose your appetite. I've been living with the disease for six years and it's been incredibly difficult. I get large cysts, sometimes the size of baseballs.. in my underarms, between my breasts and in my groin area. This makes it so hard to move any of my extremities, really. My insurance recently stopped paying for my medications, so I'm having to spend $2,200 a month to keep myself able to function properly. I have tried so hard to keep myself above water, but it's impossible with all of the medical bills from radiation therapy (not covered by insurance) and medication expense. I'd really love to have something, ANYTHING for dinner. Of course, when I'm able, I will pay it forward.
