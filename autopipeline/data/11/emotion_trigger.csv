Can someone give me something to hope for, something that can help me be even a bit positive about the future? <SEP> Thanks.",anticipation,I really need to hear any hopeful words right now because the mood in our city is beyond dire.

 Just wanting some similar stories with good outcomes maybe? <SEP> And the time line to expect with this fever? Right now the 10 year old is getting hit the hardest with fever. <SEP> We've been rotating Tylenol and motrin every 3 to 4 hours per her pediatrician and she's still coughing quite a bit and saying her belly is hurting some. <SEP> Same with the 12 year old but her fever is only a low grade one.

Sister calls Sunday evening to tell me that her husband can't smell or taste. <SEP> I immediately go get the kids and bring them home. Monday night the 2 older kids start coughing with no fever. <SEP> Tuesday they feel like crap so I go get some rapid tests from Walmart. <SEP> Sure enough they're positive. <SEP> Right now the 10 year old is getting hit the hardest with fever. <SEP> We've been rotating Tylenol and motrin every 3 to 4 hours per her pediatrician and she's still coughing quite a bit and saying her belly is hurting some. <SEP> Same with the 12 year old but her fever is only a low grade one. <SEP> I'm not sure why the fever is scaring me so bad that they have. They're really good kids and decided it would be best if they quarantined to their room and wore a mask when they had to come out so they don't get their little sister sick. I've struggled this entire pandemic to keep their lives as normal as possible while still trying to keep them safe and I'm feeling like a massive failure right now.,anticipation,Just wanting some similar stories with good outcomes maybe? <SEP> And the time line to expect with this fever?
" I really had to go to the bathroom and rushed off, in the process completely forgetting to put on my mask between going to the table to the restroom. <SEP> There were two other people in there (masked), and I was completely maskless.

I'm convinced I'm going to contract the Omicron variant from my stupid mistake, and it just doesn't feel like it was worth it. I'm going to do a rapid test tomorrow or the following day, but I can't shake this upset. I feel like such an idiot putting myself at risk like that.",anger,"I really had to go to the bathroom and rushed off, in the process completely forgetting to put on my mask between going to the table to the restroom. <SEP> There were two other people in there (masked), and I was completely maskless."
